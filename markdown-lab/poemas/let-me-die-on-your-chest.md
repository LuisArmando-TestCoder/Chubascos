Let me die on your chest,

let's take time to digest,

how wonderful your skinny jeans,

while you are topless.

&nbsp;

Rest In Peace

Quiet days,

I'm screaming:

Catch my breath.

&nbsp;

Fuck and fight,

that's what I

In the head,

I profess.

&nbsp;

Didn’t my eyes belong

to my face,

Why can't I

Pause my staring?

&nbsp;

Stare me back,

Lost in irises,

Hollow abysses,

I'm throwing myself

Into two pupils.

&nbsp;

I’m awake,

But too numb to

Run away.

&nbsp;

On this dead bed,

On your chest,

On your lips,

On your kisses,

Good bye thoughts.

&nbsp;

Catch my breath,

Good bye thoughts,

I don't need them,

but to sink

on your skin,

And let go,

All my fingers.

&nbsp;

Make them crawl

Further than

Any man

Has ever touched

The tenderness

Made a human.
