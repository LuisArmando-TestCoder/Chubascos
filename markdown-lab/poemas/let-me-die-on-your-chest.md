Let me die on your chest,

let's take time to digest,

how wonderful your skinny jeans,

while you are topless.

&nbsp;

Fuck and fight,

that's what I

profess.

&nbsp;

Blow my mind,

In the head,

Rest In Peace

Quiet days,

I'm screaming:

Catch my breath.

&nbsp;

Am I your ragdoll,

Am I just powerless,

Didn’t my eyes belong to me,

Then why can't stop staring,

lost in pupils,

Those irises,

Hollow abyss,

Stare me back,

And I'll throw myself

Into the abyss.

&nbsp;

I’m awake,

But too numb to

Run away,

Keep me warm,

In this dead bed,

On your chest,

On your lips,

On your kisses,

Catch my breath,

Good bye thoughts,

I don't need

none of those

but to sink

on your skin.
