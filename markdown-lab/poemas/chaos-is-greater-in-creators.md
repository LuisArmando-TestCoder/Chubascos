Chaos is greater in creators,

chaos is greater in leaders, 

chaos is the language of nature.

&nbsp;

I want to let people unravel it,

and put everything that belittles it

away.

&nbsp;

Fear is an enemy of true chaos,

as chaos is freedom,

the one that God looks at

so interested,

as God is a fan

of shape shifting.

&nbsp;

Letting each other be

is to promote evolution,

and evolution is chaotic,

just like the steps of children

through a path of mistakes,

towards learning the proccess

of opening the Gates of Heaven.

&nbsp;

That sweet spot

in which you find a cycle

you want to keep repeating.
