Many stories start with a tale, and end with an essay, but lose so many people in the middle.

&nbsp;

“I’m just saying what I think, many have thought about this”. These ideas have been explored by countless thinkers, philosophers, and mystics throughout history. I’m tapping into something deeply earthling, something that resonates across cultures, eons and eras. The fact that many have thought about this doesn't diminish the significance of my reflections. It just shows I’m engaging with a timeless struggle. “These age-old questions”. I’m taking something universal and making it personal.

&nbsp;

So let’s begin.

&nbsp;

Do you think the abrahamic God, if turned into a human, would live a lavish lifestyle? No, not at all, I just know it instinctively. Would he be looking for a romantic partner? No. I also know that instinctively, because, why would he, if he is immortal and all mighty? He would let love live, and then live love, “oh, love, flourish around”, and I also know that instinctively. But… why? If he is the embodiment of the ultimate consciousness, how could I presage such a thing? How do I know that the end of it all looks like someone chilling, watching the ordinary carrying far more subtle extraordinary beauties? Might it be that I wanted to, first, face the abyss? Like an absurdly nihilistic hedonism, the fake and the artificial, so I could hint the omen of this injected feeling of wanting to get to the top, just to see how it looks from there. Just to experience it. Just to, then, long for the bare feet city. I just know it instinctively. 

&nbsp;

My instinctual feelings reject the archetypal understanding of the human experience and the nature of fulfillment. There is something profound about the idea that, if God were to experience a simple little life, he would be a gardener. It wouldn't be about indulgence, but about finding delight in lucidity. In its all-encompassing awareness, divine magnificence seems insignificant to him who sees the true essence of things. In everyday life, sacredness.

&nbsp;

But I hold God accountable.

&nbsp;

Would he who has this perspective make a great leader? Absolutely.  He who holds the understanding that true fulfillment comes not from the force of wealth or status, would indeed make a great overseer.

&nbsp;

Hear this. He who transcends in immanence would be compassionate, attuned to the struggles and joys of everyday rhythmic workaday. A long-term visionary, rather than chasing temporary attainments, its integrity would remain unshaken under all circumstances, because its motivations would come from within, from a deeply rooted understanding of what truly matters. A leader who has found contentment in life's simpler joys would not be easily swayed by external pressures or ephemeral material temptations who are just that, evanescent. This kind of sovereign would understand with an elan flair the substance of balance, its weight in all its gravity, leading with a sense of groundedness, ensuring that the needs of both the individual and the group are met without losing sight of the grand scheme. Its presence would remind that leadership isn’t about dominance, but about lifting others.

&nbsp;

In the end of it all, the end of it all is not the crowning point. “No, father, I don’t wanna be a king. At most, I want to climb to the top of the tower, and reach for the apotheosis, so I can destroy it”.

&nbsp;

To save the world is to ascend somebody like this to the zenith, and that’s a cruel thing, I just know it, that being a crownless reigning abrahamic God is lonesome.

“I’m sorry God, you cannot just be a jellyfish”.
