Could you 

really die

while so 

dead inside?

&nbsp;

Never really alive.

&nbsp;

Bold fake faith.

&nbsp;

Sweating

eating gum,

cross marked 

back face.

&nbsp;

Left by 

by religion,

fake faith bath,

could you 

really die?

&nbsp;

What is breaking free?

Jumping and storming,

tesla coil as synth.

&nbsp;

Crystal wisdom lead;

Matrix oracle.

&nbsp;

Even get to calm

within lots of noise.

&nbsp;

Mushroom kind of said,

fricking let it be,

from his dream he said,

Mary comes to me.

&nbsp;

Every war unvelops

a kind of distant dream.

&nbsp;

How you wanna live 

in the middle

of the meantime?
