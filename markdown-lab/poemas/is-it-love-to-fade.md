Is it love to fade?

to give up on a dream?

to forget about lies?

to fall for somebody?

 

To love is to give up

in their caresses,

to love is to caress

regardless of their silence.

 

To love is to care completely,

to love is to give if needed,

to love is to love yourself

to love somebody.

 

To love is to be

available in secret,

to love is to love

regardless.

 

Love is to give up

on deciding

who you are going to spend

the rest of your life with.
