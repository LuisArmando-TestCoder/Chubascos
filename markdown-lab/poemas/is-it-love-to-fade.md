Is it love to fade?

to give up on a dream?

to forget about lies?

to fall for somebody?

&nbsp;

To love is to give up

in their caresses.

&nbsp;

To love is to caress

regardless of their silence.

&nbsp;

To love is to care completely;

to love is to give if needed.

&nbsp;

To love is to love yourself

to love somebody.

&nbsp;

To love is to be

available in secret.

&nbsp;

To love is to love

regardless.

&nbsp;

Love is to give up

on deciding

who you are going to spend

the rest of your life with.

&nbsp;

Love is not a choice,

is a happening.
