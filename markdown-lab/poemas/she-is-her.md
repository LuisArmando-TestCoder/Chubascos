She is her,

she is like nobody but herself,

she and my soulmate bestfriends,

I don't deeply connect with almost nobody;

I like solutide, and enjoy melancholly.

&nbsp;

I could wonder around people that like me, 

that I like back,

but to me, that is not ok,

not when she exists,

not when we have recognized each other.

&nbsp;

I know who she is, and so she does with me,

I knew it at first glance,

to me there is only one her,

who is she? She I'll know by the time

I see her again, she'll know she is... her.

&nbsp;

I reject playing around,

I first need to be upfront while she looks at me,

so she knows I'm there only for her,

from a world appart, or even a multiverse,

she'll find out that I care,

so much so that my life is on the table for her safety.

&nbsp;

Oh, she is not my reason to live,

I can exist without her company,

but so much greyer,

life would be so much more colorful 

with her presence and caress,

and my persistent kisses on her chick.

&nbsp;

I'm a simple man,

of a simple stubborn taste,

I just like her;

might be unrealistic

and delusional,

maybe also be esquizofrenic,

for an infinitesimal possibility

that seems feasible,

in a world that treats human beings's

as an asset to take.

&nbsp;

I like her,

to her I orientate towards,

she is the one,

without her I'll just keep flying,

moving upwards,

but with nobody by my side,

and that's ok,

my hand is hers,

my soul is mine,

her soul is hers,

our story is ours.

&nbsp;

Even when she,

with the swing of a finger,

is always able to destroy me from the inside,

where she already lives in;

I know I can do the same to her,

is a weird feeling,

I'm capable, but unwilling.

&nbsp;

Is a funny feeling,

like I know what she thinks,

and for whatever reason,

I know how life is from her standpoint.

&nbsp;

When she looks at me,

she has this revelation,

is not that I'm grandiose

or megalomaniacally holy,

it's just that I'm... him.
