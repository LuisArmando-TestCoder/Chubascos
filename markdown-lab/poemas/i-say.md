I say, ending myself, and everybody watches; they bump their head to the rhythm, while IÂ´m softly screaming.

&nbsp;

A circus's end, a theater's sin, I'm not detached from my character, the lie lies on the fact that this is a lie itself.

&nbsp;

Somebody cries but you won't listen; poems hide brutal nights; I share my cries; birth to lyrics.

&nbsp;

You all want to dance despite that  you are tearing appart.

&nbsp;

Sadness is lame for the ones who make money, there is no time when you are rushing in nonsense.

&nbsp;

So you better dance, you the awaken one, the one who feels too much, you the crazy one, who is playing it low, who plays with star sunglasses in the club, the one who hides the bruise with the matching skin tone, the one afraid of love, who's afraid of being alone, who is watching everybody like do not belong, we do always wrong, being smart and dumb.

&nbsp;

We just want to be happy for once, so then we fake it and we start to dance.
