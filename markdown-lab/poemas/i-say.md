I say, ending myself, and everybody watches, bumping their head to the rhythm, but, hey dump fucks, IÂ´m softly screaming.

&nbsp;

A circus's end, a theater's sin, the lie is not a lie, the game is not a game, from the character, I'm not detached, I'm really screaming.

&nbsp;

Somebody cries and you won't freaking listen; poems hide brutal nights; I share my cries; evil birth to lyrics.

&nbsp;

You all want just to dance despite the fact that appart you are tearing.

&nbsp;

Sadness is lame in the money world; better take a pill; your problem is not soved; there is no time for us while we are rushing in stories.

&nbsp;

So you better dance, you the awaken one, who feels too much; you the crazy one, who is playing it low, who plays a star, sunglasses, the club; the one who hides their bruises with skin tones.

&nbsp;

That one afraid of love, who's afraid of being alone, who is watching everybody like do not in fact belong, we do always wrong, being smart and dumb.

&nbsp;

We just want to be happy for once, so we fake it and we start to dance.

&nbsp;

Laugh at the face of past miseries, past enemies, who made us feel like shit, specially, the loved ones, the ones we hate.
