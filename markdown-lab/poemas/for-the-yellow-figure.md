For the yellow figure

of open arms,

in the darkness you reside,

of the abyss

you are the light,

light for the abandoned,

for the monsters

sensitive to comments;

you are the love

they were denied.

&nbsp;

I love you with all my soul,

as in my soul

is that you reside,

like a blazing eternal candle,

from you, 

emergent wonders.
