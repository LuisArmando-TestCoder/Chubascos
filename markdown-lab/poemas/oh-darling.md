Oh! Darling,

why would you

treat yourself so badly?

you and your

tomboyish outfits

look perfect.

&nbsp;

Endearing,

all the assets that I notice,

you might be explosive

for somethings,

like justice;

your fire brings life

to newer beginnings,

cleans the floor from liers.

&nbsp;

You might hide your shyness

with aggressive faces,

but that is perfect,

I see right through,

I'm winning.

&nbsp;

I don't need you

to be in my palm,

my palms are yours only,

in which you rest.

&nbsp;

Captivating.

&nbsp;

If you only knew

all this I'm thinking,

but I won't wake you up

from your dreaming,

you look so cute,

so happy, so peaceful,

meanwhile, I'm a pillow.
