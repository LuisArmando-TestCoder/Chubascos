There is a light

that never dies,

invisible to daylight,

each and every night.

&nbsp;

Before the dawn

some walk pass by,

some little hope,

for a little while.

&nbsp;

There is a light

that never dies,

made for all the nomads,

each and every night.

&nbsp;

Before the rise of the Sun,

there is a light;

extended stain

that gets sliced.

&nbsp;

There is a light,

that never dies;

there is a light,

each and every night.
