Mistaken me for someone else

just I don't know yet who I am.

&nbsp;

Please, look at me, please, don't you see;

please, don't neglect my humanity.

&nbsp;

I didn't ask to be myself,

a disaster, freak and cataclysm.

&nbsp;

I don't want your expectations,

or to want all your failed dreams.

&nbsp;

I'm myself, but I don't know,

let me go, please, to figure it out,

I want to get lost,

to know I was wrong,

let me taste life,

please, let me go.

&nbsp;

I don't want to be a  pet,

I'm not a doll to rag.

&nbsp;

Not a test subject,

not a resource,

I'm my persona,

but don't you know

that I'm alive,

is you that make me wish

that I was dead.
