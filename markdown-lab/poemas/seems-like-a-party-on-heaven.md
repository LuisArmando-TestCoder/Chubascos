Seems like a party on Heaven

in which I am not.

&nbsp;

Am I the sinner since

a long time ago?

&nbsp;

Your absence purges me;

I burn in cold.

&nbsp;

Where's my salvation?

Somebody come,

I'm starving;

somebody come,

please come and hug me;

I don't wanna burn cold.

&nbsp;

Sanity is broken by snow;

you, Mr Void,

shattered my bones,

I jumped from a rooftop;

asleep on the floor;

my body is long gone.

&nbsp;

Baby, I tried it,

I tried to be good,

but good was not cool;

I was your dog.

&nbsp;

Did you make sadness,

so me and my voices

could drown in cold,

while others don't?

&nbsp;

Sanity is broken by snow;

you, Mr Void,

shattered my bones,

I jumped from a rooftop;

asleep on the floor;

my body is long gone.

&nbsp;

In the name of delusion,

is this a joke?

in the name of delusion,

I wish not to wish;

in the name of delusion,

I wish that you save me;

in the name of delusion,

I wish I forget

your hunter eyes.

&nbsp;

Babe packed his stuff

didn't he love me?

Why is he smiling

as I go cold?

&nbsp;

Sanity is broken by snow;

you, Mr Void,

shattered my bones,

I jumped from a rooftop;

asleep on the floor;

my body is long gone now.

&nbsp;

My babe is long gone,

as I burn in cold;

seems like a party on Heaven

in which I am not.
