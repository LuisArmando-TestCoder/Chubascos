Seems like a party on Heaven

in which I am not.

&nbsp;

Am I the sinner since

a long time ago?

&nbsp;

Your absence is purging me

as I burn in cold.

&nbsp;

Where's my salvation?

Somebody come,

I'm starving;

somebody come,

please come and hug me;

so I don't burn cold.

&nbsp;

Sanity is broken by snow;

you, Mr Void,

shattered my bones,

I jumped from a rooftop;

asleep on the floor;

my body is long gone.

&nbsp;

Baby, I tried it,

I tried to be good,

but good was not cool;

I was your dog.

&nbsp;

Did you make sadness,

so me and my voices

could drown in cold,

while others don't?

&nbsp;

Sanity is broken by snow;

you, Mr Void,

shattered my bones,

I jumped from a rooftop;

asleep on the floor;

my body is long gone.

&nbsp;

In the name of delusion,

are you the joke?

In the name of delusion,

to never come back;

In the name of delusion,

like we don't exist;

In the name of delusion,

I wish not to wish,

In the name of delusion,

I wish you save me.

&nbsp;

Babe packed his stuff

didn't he love me?

Why is he smiling

as I go cold?

&nbsp;

Sanity is broken by snow;

you, Mr Void,

shattered my bones,

I jumped from a rooftop;

asleep on the floor;

my body is long gone.

&nbsp;

My babe is long gone,

meanwhile I burn;

seems like a party on Heaven

in which I am not.
