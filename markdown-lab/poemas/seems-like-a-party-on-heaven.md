Seems like a party on Heaven

in which I am not.

&nbsp;

Daddy, I'm a sinner

since a long time ago,

do you need me to purge

my own rachitic soul?

&nbsp;

Where's my salvation,

somebody come,

I am starving,

somebody come,

please come and hug me,

I'm tired of being alone.

&nbsp;

Believe me I tried it,

I tried to be good,

but good was not cool;

I was your dog.

&nbsp;

Did you make sadness,

so we go cold,

while others don't,

so they are grateful

my shoes are not their own?

&nbsp;

Sanity is broken by snow,

you, Mr void,

shattered my bones in the floor,

freezed me in my conscious,

asleep on the floor,

from somebody's rooftop,

my body is long gone

for a lack of warm.

&nbsp;

In the name of delusion,

are you the joke?

&nbsp;

You never come no more;

you behaved like us;

we don't exist at all:

I wish I wished no more.

&nbsp;

I wish that you saved me regardless

of my paranoia,

but no,

you are long gone.

&nbsp;

Dad packed his stuff

to his children in Heaven,

he fled a long time ago;

you are no savior.

&nbsp;

Didn't you love us?

why are you smiling

as we go cold?

no love,

God killed himself.
