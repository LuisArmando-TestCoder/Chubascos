Seems like a party on Heaven,

at which I was not invited on.

&nbsp;

Daddy, I'm a sinner

since a long time ago,

can I still go,

or, do you need me to purge

my own soul?

&nbsp;

Where's my salvation,

somebody come,

I am starving,

please somebody come,

please come and hug me,

I'm tired of being alone.

&nbsp;

Believe me I tried it,

I tried to be good,

but good was not cool,

as I was your dog.

&nbsp;

Did you make sadness,

as that is really the only thing

that comes from me.

I go cold and I burn.

&nbsp;

Did you make sadness,

so I go cold,

while others don't,

so they can feel grateful

to not wear my shoes?

&nbsp;

My sanity is broken by snow,

you, Mr void,

shattered my bones in the floor,

freezed my conscious

from a thirteenth floor,

my body shattered

was already long gone

for a lack of warm.

&nbsp;

In the name of delusion,

are you the joke,

are you the problem

weÂ´re coming from?

&nbsp;

You behaved like us,

as we don't exist at all,

and you never come no more,

I wish you saved me regardless,

I wish not wishing.

&nbsp;

Dad packed his stuff

a long time ago,

fled to his children in Heaven;

you are not a savior;

where is our mom?

&nbsp;

Didn't you love me?

why are you smiling

as I go cold?
