Seems like a party on Heaven

in which I am not.

&nbsp;

Babe, I'm a sinner since

a long time ago,

do you need me to purge

my rachitic soul?

&nbsp;

Where's my salvation,

somebody come,

I'm starving,

somebody come,

please come and hug me,

I'm tired of being alone,

deprived from the wonders

my babe ripped off.

&nbsp;

Believe me I tried it,

I tried to be good,

but good was not cool;

I was your dog.

&nbsp;

Did you make sadness,

so we could go cold,

me and my voices,

while others don't,

so they are grateful

that they're not us?

&nbsp;

Sanity is broken by snow,

you, Mr void,

shattered my bones,

asleep on the floor;

from somebody's rooftop

my body is long gone.

&nbsp;

In the name of delusion,

are you the joker?

&nbsp;

You never come;

behaved like

we don't exist,

and I wish

I wished no more;

but I wish you saved me,

but you are long gone.

&nbsp;

Babe packed his stuff

didn't he love me?

why is he smiling

as I go cold?

&nbsp;

Where is my warm?

babe is long gone.
