Seems like a party on Heaven

in which I am not.

&nbsp;

I am a sinner since

a long time ago;

do you need me to purge

my rachitic soul?

&nbsp;

Where's my salvation?

Somebody come,

I'm starving;

somebody come,

please come and hug me;

I'm tired of being alone,

deprived from the loving

my babe ripped me off from.

&nbsp;

Baby I tried it,

I tried to be good,

but good was not cool;

I was your dog.

&nbsp;

Did you make sadness,

so me and my voices,

so we could go cold,

while others don't?

&nbsp;

Sanity is broken by snow;

you, Mr Void; you, Mr Abyss,

shattered my bones,

asleep on the floor;

somebody's rooftop;

my body is long gone.

&nbsp;

In the name of delusion,

are you the joke?

&nbsp;

You never come;

like we don't exist,

and I wish

I wished no more;

but I wish you saved me,

but you are long gone.

&nbsp;

Babe packed his stuff

didn't he love me?

Why is he smiling

as I go cold?

&nbsp;

Where is my warm?

babe is long gone.
