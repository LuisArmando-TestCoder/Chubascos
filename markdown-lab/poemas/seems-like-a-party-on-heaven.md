Seems like a party on Heaven

in which I am not.

&nbsp;

Babe, I'm a sinner

a long time ago,

do you need me to purge

my rachitic soul?

&nbsp;

Where's my salvation,

somebody come,

I'm starving,

somebody come,

please come and hug me,

I'm tired of being alone,

deprived from the wonders

my babe ripped off.

&nbsp;

Believe me I tried it,

I tried to be good,

but good was not cool;

I was your dog.

&nbsp;

Did you make sadness,

so we could go cold,

while others don't,

so they are grateful

that they're not us?

&nbsp;

Sanity is broken by snow,

you, Mr void,

shattered my bones in the floor,

freezed me in my conscious,

asleep on the floor

from somebody's rooftop,

my body is long gone.

&nbsp;

In the name of delusion,

are you the joke?

&nbsp;

You never come no more;

you behaved like us;

we don't exist at all;

I wish I wished no more;

but I wish that you saved me

regardless of everything,

of my paranoia,

but you are long gone.

&nbsp;

Babe packed his stuff

to his children in Heaven,

he fled, long time ago;

didn't he love me?

why is he smiling

as I go cold?

&nbsp;

Where is my warm?

babe is long gone.
