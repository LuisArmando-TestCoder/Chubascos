I do not need no immortality,

immortals die inside eternity,

I just need the pumps of my heart,

that free me from slavery.

&nbsp;

Free when I'm falling

in the middle of deep space.

&nbsp;

Caress lightning strokes,

I'm flowing while lonely,

enlightened in secret.

&nbsp;

Instructs me, keep living;

chaotic awareness

merging with wavelengths.

&nbsp;

I'm not perfection,

I'm just myself,

just me and rhythm

and nobody else.

&nbsp;

Drowning in darkness

and won't suffocate.

&nbsp;

Just like a feather,

I'm letting myself

float, soak.

&nbsp;

The truth didn't care,

truths everywhere.

&nbsp;

The forces of nature

guide me through instinct,

science, my body

attaching to it,

my doubts are extinct.

&nbsp;

Thinking beyond,

I feel comfortable

within the unknown.

&nbsp;

In the middle of nowhere

there is somebody like me,

my sight does the bow

and so do those eyes bow to me.

&nbsp;

With intersections

we keep our ways,

keeping direction,

we're obstinate.

&nbsp;

Hardheaded,

we live our terms,

regardless of dangers,

regardless of hurt.

&nbsp;

We draw a path

for each of our steps.

&nbsp;

We want our neurons to fire.

&nbsp;

Lost in the flow state,

there is no meaning.

&nbsp;

Want to keep going,

we want to fluctuate.

&nbsp;

Time will run over,

but we do not care.

&nbsp;

There is no future,

there is nobody,

here is today.

&nbsp;

Abandon the right world,

in madness we fade.

&nbsp;

Follow our madness,

in madness we lay.

&nbsp;

We are ethereum,

babel of aims.

&nbsp;

Stubborn for wonder,

smiling we faint.

&nbsp;

Goals dispel

all of our aims.

&nbsp;

We are here now,

facing all now.

&nbsp;

Destined wonder,

within your flare

we burst out loud.
