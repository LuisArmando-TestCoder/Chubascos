You are not

as a whole body

better than nobody,

you don't have to be,

you are what you are.

&nbsp;

Keep it on,

carry on

on your path,

even if it is

an straight line,

or full of vertices,

a non euclidean track.

&nbsp;

Believe that you will

reach your destination,

as you have nothing

but your faith,

but not the esoteric one,

but the innermost latent.
