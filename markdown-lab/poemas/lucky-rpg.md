Lucky RPG.

&nbsp;

Don't know where I could go

with this creepy face.

&nbsp;

I force a creepy smile that swells.

&nbsp;

My eyes dry drown again.

&nbsp;

Indifference, the one,

you are killing me.

&nbsp;

Lucky RPG.

&nbsp;

I wanted others love,

I'm giving up this dream.

&nbsp;

People don't want ugly.

&nbsp;

Indifference, the one,

you are killing me.

&nbsp;

Lucky RPG.

&nbsp;

With no factual answers

I'm keeping up my will.

&nbsp;

Might I want to go,

colors off my skin.

&nbsp;

Cannot get it right 

from the moment I was born.

&nbsp;

People don't want ugly.

&nbsp;

Is God laughing at my soul?

&nbsp;

Damage, metaphysical.

&nbsp;

Can I walk straight again?

&nbsp;

Black skybox that displays

rainbow monochrome.

&nbsp;

Want so bad just to wake up 

from the opposite of love.

&nbsp;

Without love I cannot live.

&nbsp;

But people don't want ugly.

&nbsp;

Indifference, the one.

&nbsp;

Lucky RPG.

&nbsp;

Indifference is the one

that is killing me.
