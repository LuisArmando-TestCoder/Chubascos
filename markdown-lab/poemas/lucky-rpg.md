Lucky RPG.

&nbsp;

Don't know where I could go

with this creepy face.

&nbsp;

A creepy smile that swells.

&nbsp;

My eyes dry drown again.

&nbsp;

Indifference, the one,

you are killing me.

&nbsp;

I wanted others's love,

I'm giving up this dream.

&nbsp;

They don't want unsightly.

&nbsp;

Indifference to me.

&nbsp;

With no factual answers.

&nbsp;

Colors off my skin.

&nbsp;

Cannot get it right.

&nbsp;

Is God laughing at my soul?

&nbsp;

The hurt feels metaphysical.

&nbsp;

Can I walk again?

&nbsp;

Skybox that displays

rainbow monochrome.

&nbsp;

Want so bad to wake up

from the opposite of love.

&nbsp;

Without love I cannot live.

&nbsp;

They don't want unsightly.

&nbsp;

Nowhere to be seen.

&nbsp;

Indifference, the one

that 's killing me.
