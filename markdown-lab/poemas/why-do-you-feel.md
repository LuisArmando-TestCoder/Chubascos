Why do you feel

this pressure in your chest,

who has your heart, darling?

Who is holding it so irresponsibly?

Is it yourself?

Are you the one taking care

of your loneliness?

Do you see such beauty as ugliness?

&nbsp;

I like nobody, I only like photons,

that is why I enjoy sitting down

by your sun-flare,

I'm a light chaser,

dreamy highway racer,

ethereal art taster. 

&nbsp;

We are alike in a sense,

I can appreciate strangers,

but to appreciate myself,

how would I? I know my sins.

&nbsp;

I do understand what I feel like,

I sometimes dream of

dying in a car accident,

saving a kid or a dog,

saving a chicken

is a sign of bravery.

&nbsp;

I prefer living mute

and stoically

and dying heroically,

but deep inside,

I am craving for prosperity,

maybe, if there is none here,

there might be,

in another life.

&nbsp;

I'm not someone that you can buy,

is my value infinite then?

How is "invaluable"

different from "worthless"?

&nbsp;

The most interesting people

are contradictory,

they love others so hard,

or they love themselves extremely,

their unbalanced love

tends to make them fall apart.

&nbsp;

Goodness lord,

I do not wish to live in a world

without you,

do you think the same as I?

As you are so great of an addition,

all the other past idiots

got a purpose,

to make your birth

an increasing likelihood. 

&nbsp;

The one gem standing

in between all that nitrate,

why don't you see yourself as I,

is it because you have not

caught yourself smiling?

Is my testimony not good enough

for you to get it?

I guess living gems

exclude themselves

from what they consider worthy.

&nbsp;

Is it hard

to be unobtainable, untamable?

Are you really so hard to get,

or are you waiting for your god

to come and get you?

I guess I should ask my proud mirror.

&nbsp;

Maybe this pride

is the baggage we carry.

Maybe the pain solely lies

in the paradoxical theory

that we are all gods

not looking at each other,

while the fuel of these observers,

addicted to feelings,

is having crowds

submitting to them in prayers,

while they become surrounded

by caress givers,

but they are alone and pathetic.

&nbsp;

Most of what there is, in this era,

is gods wanting other gods to vow,

but they will not

kneel to each other,

which one will give

its divine status up?

&nbsp;

Gods are scared of

the opposite of love,

which they gestate daily,

they are scared

of loving and not being loved back,

so they do not love at all.

&nbsp;

Indifference and time

is the god slaying sword

that is slaying everybody.

&nbsp;

Are you, precious goddess,

fed up with that pressure

in your chest?

Are you another egocentric dreamer

facing the fact that nobody

is going to come and get you,

unless you speak up

and raise your hand?

And even then,

maybe the people you love

might not love you back.

&nbsp;

I think I'm fed up,

I'm feeling like ripping

some veils apart,

so many cocoons stacked

are choking each other

towards their metamorphoses,

I want to liberate you,

so watch,

I can kneel and then stand up

to stand my ground:

I don't need no godly status;

I don't need no tag;

I'm minimal and vast.

&nbsp;

I'd like to raise you up,

so you can fly,

so you realize,

status and high class

is not a part of any pyramid,

altitude it's just an axis.
