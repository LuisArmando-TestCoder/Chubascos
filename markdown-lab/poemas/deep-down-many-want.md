Deep down many want

and only want

the ones that are worth it,

and those Pandora's boxes

want somebody

brilliant and genuine,

somebody to bright them up

from the abyss that they,

sometimes, are facing,

for when they realize,

in their awakening,

that we all are floating

in the middle of deep space

in an infinitesimal pale blue dot,

carelessly.

&nbsp;

The ones that are worth it

are meant to be loved authentically,

to balance out

how lonely they might be feeling

in that peak of existence

they sit on

in their hallucinations,

even though somebody might tell them:

“how can you feel lonely,

if you are surrounded by the Everything,

isn't this your chance to take it?”.

And as they hear that,

they'll start imagining.
