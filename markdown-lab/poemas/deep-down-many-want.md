Deep down many want

and only want

the ones that are worth it,

and those Pandora's boxes

want somebody

brilliant and genuine,

somebody to bright them up

from the abyss that they,

sometimes, are facing,

for when they realize,

in their awakening,

that we all are floating

in the middle of deep space

in an infinitesimal pale blue dot,

carelessly.
