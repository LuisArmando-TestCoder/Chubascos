Let me show you, my darling,

let me show you all your wonders,

oh, in front of our reflection

I can see in you the first of them.

&nbsp;

Come on over here, my darling,

let me show you wonders,

in front of our reflection

I can tell you that

the first of them it's you.

&nbsp;

Come on,

tell yourself,

tell yourself how much you love

to caught yourself smiling.

&nbsp;

Let me show you

how wonderful you are,

you holy reflection

of our faith and will.

&nbsp;

Let me show you

how strong you are;

despite this path

being quite this tough.

&nbsp;

All your scars

are masterworks;

a story that is told;

a body that's a scroll;

you are precious as a whole;

but let me show you

the wonders that

you are made of.
