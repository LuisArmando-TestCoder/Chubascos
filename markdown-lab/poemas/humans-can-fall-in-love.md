Humans can fall in love

multiple times,

but I just find everybody else

so hideous,

but here you are,

singular to my sight.

&nbsp;

I do not understand

how to love like them,

how to crush so fast,

as I fall for your aura,

which takes time;

with your words, chosen,

gracefully drawn by your mouth;

with your eyebrows

that tide on shore;

with the "getting to know"

in silence

by your side;

with the loud passionate hands

that play aside;

with your swirling drilling eyes,

that drill mine.

&nbsp;

Your gaze is like a knife

stabbed in my chest.

As far as I can tell,

I refuse to die,

I will get back up

again and again,

every time your eyelids dawn,

to be caught in the morning

by your bright two suns.

&nbsp;

Yes, yes, you are beautiful,

but more beautiful inside,

and that, I do not obviate,

even if you become sad, or fade,

I will keep kissing

your inner light.
