Hurts to be told

that you don't matter.

&nbsp;

Hurts to be told

that you're a soldier,

to die for her sins

of greed and stutter.

&nbsp;

Hurts to be told

that you don't belong

and she doesn't care;

your life doesn't matter.

&nbsp;

Thinks she's the one,

that she's alive,

that she's awake,

but she is nothing

but naked in front of the world

that lusts over for her,

she likes the attention

never given before.

&nbsp;

This is a mask,

the mask of a man,

the mask is a rock

that is not awake,

that doesn't love hard,

that is not insane,

insane for your lost.

&nbsp;

I'm telling nobody,

nobody will care.

As soon as I tell them;

command: just, be well.

&nbsp;

I'm used to not care

and sing my sad songs

and carry insane

the weight of my rocks.

&nbsp;

And they tell me then

pretty poem you wrote

you are an artist;

I felt your words.

&nbsp;

I'm just screaming

I'm not a man,

I am alive,

I am awake,

I love so hard,

and then I fail.

&nbsp;

I fail to be loved back

by the love of my life.

&nbsp;

I've live thousand lives

but she has not 

lived one of those by my side,

eventhough, she was my ghost

a thousand times.

&nbsp;

She thinks I don't care,

I hide so much

the much I love her,

I hide much more.

&nbsp;

I'm just screaming

I'm not a man,

I am alive,

I am awake,

I love so hard,

and then I fail.

&nbsp;

This is a mask,

the mask of a man,

the mask is a rock

that is not awake,

that doesn't love hard,

that is not insane,

insane for your lost.
