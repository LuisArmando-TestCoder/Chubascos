Hurts to be told

that you don't matter.

&nbsp;

Hurts to be told

that you're a martyr,

to die for her sins;

greed and stutter.

&nbsp;

Hurts to be told:

you don't belong;

she doesn't care;

your life doesn't matter.

&nbsp;

Thinks she's the one,

that she's alive,

that she's awake,

that she loves hard,

but she is nothing

but naked in front

my well dressed up pain.

&nbsp;

This is a mask,

the mask of a man,

I'm not awake,

I don't love hard,

I'm not insane,

I'm not alive,

men do not cry.

&nbsp;

I'm telling nobody,

nobody will care.

As soon as I tell them;

command: just, be well.

&nbsp;

I'm used to not care

and sing my sad songs

and carry insane

the weight of my rocks.

&nbsp;

And they tell me then

pretty poem you wrote

you are an artist;

I felt your words.

&nbsp;

I'm just screaming

I'm not a man,

I am alive,

I am awake,

I love so hard,

and then I fail.

&nbsp;

I fail to be loved back

by the love of my life.

&nbsp;

I've live thousand lives

but she has not 

lived one of those by my side,

eventhough, she was my ghost

a thousand times.

&nbsp;

She thinks I don't care,

I hide so much,

how much I love her,

I hide much more.

&nbsp;

I'm just screaming:

I'm not a man,

I am alive,

I am awake,

I love so hard

and then I fail.

&nbsp;

This is a mask,

the mask of a man,

I'm not awake,

I don't love hard,

I'm not insane,

I'm not alive,

men do not cry.
