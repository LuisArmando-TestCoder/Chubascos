I wish that (forever)

I could be (forever)

by your side (and ever).

&nbsp;

Bare feet,

entangle the night,

entangle our skin,

entangle our lives.

&nbsp;

Touch me;

certain skim,

heal me from sins,

holy relique.

&nbsp;

Make me

hallucinate

as I embrace,

as I accept

within a kiss:

encapsulation.

&nbsp;

Whirling

further inside;

eat us,

eat us, dear night;

claws over skin,

shoulders and fangs.

&nbsp;

Darling,

dance down the shroud,

hidden in dark,

naked in veils;

with my bare hands

I see you dancing.

&nbsp;

Wrapped around neck;

fingers that scream:

love me, my dear.

&nbsp;

Shudder so strong

for a soft touch,

we shiver again,

invoking our rain.
