I already forgot about you,

wait... who am I talking about?

&nbsp;

Yesterday was a good day,

finally,

Overwatch I could play,

and so I did,

I watched anime for while,

that was neat,

so the projects on the side,

which I keep,

I grow every time,

I'm learning Japanese,

and the best of it all is

that I am free.

&nbsp;

I'm chainless my ex precious dear,

I'm saved from that poisonous kiss,

which I craved, don't get me wrong,

but, what the fuck?

Why am I saying this?

&nbsp;

I, I get hunted at night,

by all these flashing lights,

of a non as terrible

and lonely some past life.

&nbsp;

The day before yesterday,

that was ok,

I didn't consider a weird

heroic death,

I was listening my friends

and their arguments,

so I, I heard it all,

in the middle of a fight,

in the middle of a couch,

I was not surprised at all

to see blood being spilled,

but my ADHD kicked in again,

and that red looked like

that time in which we were magnified

within the room with the red lights,

fucking and chilling.

&nbsp;

The day before,

before the one that's not today,

I mean yesterday,

and so it went on,

till' the day we broke,

when that was done I felt the void,

but now this void is crisp,

wild and careless.

&nbsp;

Today I was just passing by

the flashing lights,

but wait... which memories?

today I was just being myself,

I felt there was a better me

with you next to it,

but now it's pointless.

&nbsp;

The truth of the matter is,

yes, I do feel free

and chainless,

but I wish I was handcuffed,

oh, motherfucking Zeus,

I wish I could not move

cuz you're using me as a pillow,

and even if it sounds gay

to my ultra idiotic friends,

I wish I was engaged,

together we felt like the best...

but now I'm hollow.

&nbsp;

I'm hollow and free,

free from the pain

that now I crave to meet,

I'm hollow and free,

I'm living my dreams,

but still I sense empty

the spot you could fill,

we broke on a tomb babe,

and I'm mourning still;

I could believe in Heaven,

if you were there to see,

but I'm hollow, I'm empty,

my God died with thee,

and I still remember,

and still my hands are shaking,

I vomit every morning,

I hated that you asked me,,

a good life and to keep living.
