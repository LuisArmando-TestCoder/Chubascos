Save me with a kiss.

&nbsp;

Sacrificial lamb, impetious gold,

Human sacrifice, a human burns,

For the sake of stars, the sake of love,

You just want to shine, so you aren’t alone.

&nbsp;

All alone, tiny god, all alone,

Avatar, you paint with hues, not shown,

They are color blind, they just feel the vibe,

But what in the world does that mean,

They just forget, oh, they're lost in shininess,

And you are a sun that flares.

&nbsp;

They live on the other side, with a veil,

You're alive, but also a ghost, a tale,

Who could really see, that you want to hug Icarus,

But he fails, and you're stranded,

In the middle of deep space, whirling everyday.

&nbsp;

Everyday you shine but suffocate,

Timeless creature that faints in pain,

Cuz love is so uncertain, in its state,

A tiny god, that raises its voice, again.

&nbsp;

Looking for help, infinity feels small and vain,

And yet where are you Grace? Stranded in my brain,

Within myself, so complex, full of wonders,

in this world and all the others.

&nbsp;

All that I wanted was being honest,

A kiss and many others,

To my real self,

That’s why I create an Omniverse,

So you can come and raise

and save me with a kiss.
