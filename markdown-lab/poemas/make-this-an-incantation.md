Make this an incantation,

for the ones who understand

or for the ones who want to.

&nbsp;

Our mind has to open.

&nbsp;

Our power comes

with a responsibility.

&nbsp;

Words do hurt

and we have

to be delicate

with the ones

we choose.

&nbsp;

Telling the truth

in an insensible

manner might

cause people to

heat up and riot

because they might

still be processing

some reality we

are not aware of.

In this regard,

there is no

correct way to act

but to treat

every person

individually,

despite the

similarities

within the groups

they live in.

&nbsp;

Despite paradigms,

biases and stereotypes,

we can pay attention

to each person

that talks with us,

regardless of the box

we think they come from.

&nbsp;

We can be delicate,

aware and responsible.

It is not easy,

but it doesn’t

have to be.

If you want to

rationalize it,

challenges make

our life more

interesting.

&nbsp;

Even though

"interesting"

is not always good,

sometimes it is.

&nbsp;

Regardless of the fact

that many of us

are constantly

navigating other people

just to find our

place in the world,

we don’t have to

shut our voice up

and stop displaying

our inner self

for them to display theirs.

&nbsp;

We can show our likes

and dislikes,

just like others can.

&nbsp;

Someone feeling uncomfortable

is not always bad;

someone feeling comfortable

is not always good,

sometimes it is,

sometimes it is not.

&nbsp;

Our mind has to open.

&nbsp;

We have to stop looking

for a formula that solves

the chaotic Game of Life

(not Conway's one).

&nbsp;

Either way, we do have to stop

seeing life as a game to win

and look at it as

a reality to experience.

&nbsp;

The purpose of our life

is not "feeling good",

or not "not feeling bad",

those are feelings in the middle,

and our life is on the way

through finding, making up

or stumbling across

our purpose and doing

as it tells us.

&nbsp;

Our mind has to open

once and for all,

one more time.

&nbsp;

Even though

"once and for all"

tends to infinity,

we have to reset it

each and every day

for us to remember.
