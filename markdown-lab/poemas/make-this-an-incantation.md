Make this an incantation,

for the ones who understand

or for those who want to.

&nbsp;

Our mind has to open.

&nbsp;

To some,

some words,

sometimes hurt,

we don't know them

but they need us

to be delicate

with the ones

we choose.

&nbsp;

Despite paradigms,

biases and stereotypes,

we can pay attention

to each person

that talks with us,

regardless of the box

we think they come from.

&nbsp;

We can be delicate,

aware and responsible.

&nbsp;

It is not easy,

but it doesn't

have to be.

If you want to

rationalize it,

challenges make

our life more

interesting.

&nbsp;

Even though

"interesting"

is not always good,

sometimes it is.

&nbsp;

Regardless of the fact

that many of us

are constantly

navigating other people

just to find our

place in the world,

we don't have to

shut our voice up

and stop displaying

our inner self

for them to

have the chance to

display theirs.

&nbsp;

We can show our likes

and dislikes,

just like others can.

&nbsp;

Someone feeling uncomfortable

is not always bad;

someone feeling comfortable

is not always good,

sometimes it is,

sometimes it is not.

&nbsp;

Our mind has to open.

&nbsp;

We have to stop looking

for a formula that solves

the chaotic Game of Life

(not Conway's one).

&nbsp;

Either way, we do have to stop

seeing life as a game to win

and look at it as

a reality to experience.
