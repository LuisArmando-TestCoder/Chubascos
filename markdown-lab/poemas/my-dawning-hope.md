My dawning hope,

my dreams that dawn,

Am I floating, 

reincarnating

into the Sun?

is it just me

that tears are so warm?

&nbsp;

Ominous heat,

Ashes that talk,

how in the world,

do I stand tall?

&nbsp;

I'm deranged,

light in the road,

say full of faith,

how in the world?

&nbsp;

Am I the blaze?

Smile while I burn,

am I insane?

I hope for the dawn.

&nbsp;

Ominous heat,

is this the sun?

My fingers slip;

tears are so warm.

&nbsp;

For you I mourn,

my dreams that dawn,

my dawning hope,

my dreams that dawn.
