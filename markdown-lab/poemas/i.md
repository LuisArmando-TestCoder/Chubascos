I

have had

what many people call

“disorders”,

of the psychological kind,

and of many kinds,

yet, every speck of the abyss,

every speck of fear,

every speck of uncertainty

for the unknown,

I've faced it,

“Let it all in!”,

I've screamed, while my eyes,

the eyes of the conscious observer,

those I made sure remained open,

looked at my own nature,

and nature itself looked back at me;

even what lies beyond

any conceivable limit,

I've reached it,

every extreme,

I accepted,

and my will

to live and love

remained,

it actually shifted

towards prioritizing

what I understood

was important,

which was nothing at all,

only what I told myself

was valuable in the moment

or for the ages.

&nbsp;

I've processed

even my own sense of value,

and even the fact

that I was processing

my own processes,

and so I hugged

the ever expanding recursiveness

of that statement,

I've hugged the paradox

of how to live

if the only thing

one does

is thinking,

and yet, I stopped,

I made a journal for the paradox

and saved it, time and time again,

somewhere

in the library of my thoughts.

&nbsp;

I was sleeping in shadows,

in my mind, for eons,

sometimes,

for time crystals

always going round and cyclical,

and yet, I'm here,

awake,

because I also embraced

the possibility of existing

outside of one self;

I accepted the most

non-paradoxical paradoxical statement,

my first amendment:

Everything Is Possible.

&nbsp;

And so I looked

for the origin of Everything,

and to connect it

with something,

but isn't that pursue pointless?

But everything is possible,

and so the fact that it is

indeed connected,

and so I found a thread

leading me to Nothingness;

in order for it to exist,

it needs an existence

to be separated from,

and so nothing

never existed

because everything does,

so every possibility

always does,

and Everything existed

because Nothing would not.

&nbsp;

Existence is

an emergence coming out

from nothingness,

and when I accepted that,

and the fact

that there is no ceiling

to the expansivity

of possibilities,

then I became

one with the thought:

everything is possible.

&nbsp;

I am possible,

therefore,

I'm Everything.

&nbsp;

What is the speck?

The object itself,

or the scales around it

that categorizes it as such?

What is the speck,

if not connected?

As it was perceived,

we perceived ourselves;

we are the speck.

&nbsp;

Our parents made us,

and the story of our race made them,

and the story of our ancestral beings

made our race,

and the story of existence

made those, as well,

and the story of everything

made existence exist

in the first place,

and the paradox of Nothingness

is its nest,

and so we looked back

at ourselves,

we, the cell of a body

that is also a cell,

as being a cell

is in a way

being a block

of an organism.

&nbsp;

My disorders faded out

into oblivion,

as I accepted

each and every one of them,

these were disorders no more,

and then, they didn't care

to disturb me any time soon,

they became common,

unremarkable, and not special,

as long as I remembered this:

I am outside, always present,

always there, my conscious,

my identity is the Everything.

Enlightenment is an step.
