Come on over here my darling,

let me show you all your wonders,

oh, in front of our reflection

I can see in you the first of them.

&nbsp;

Come on over here darling,

let me show you wonders,

in front of our reflection

I can tell you that

the first of them it's you.

&nbsp;

Come on,

tell yourself,

tell yourself how much you love

to caught yourself smiling.

&nbsp;

Let me show you

how wonderful you are,

reflection

with our faith and will.

&nbsp;

Let me show you

how strong you are;

this path has been quite tough;

all your scars

are your masterworks;

a body that's a scroll,

a story that is told;

you are precious as a whole.
