Adults might be like:

let me be happy being sad;

it feels so good to be alive;

I wanna enjoy being

melancholic for a while,

just thinking about my losses,

cuz life is truly beautiful.

&nbsp;

But fuck, I am so fucking fucked

and it is a little funny,

I fucking love somebody that I lost,

but it feels good to tell myself

to remember her with tender,

but I also recall not being unapologetic,

not taking the chance

to accept her blazing love,

I wish I did.

&nbsp;

Wish I had been a crazy

motherfucking god of love

with her and her only,

every day, without caring

if she even liked that from me,

or if it annoyed her at all,

but I was so scared of annoying her,

I wish I annoyed her, I wish I had.

&nbsp;

I mean, my pride aside,

It feels good to be honest

and take the knives out,

even if it hurts, but still...

&nbsp;

I don't... remember

my next words.

&nbsp;

I am losing my brain

and I am afraid.

&nbsp;

I just have my last wishes

so I keep walking a couple lot more

of sad brilliant decades without you,

cuz hearts start to die at twenty one.
