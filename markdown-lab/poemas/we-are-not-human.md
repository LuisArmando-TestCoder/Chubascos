We are not human,

we are moving beings

who can move upwards

through generations.

&nbsp;

The higher you go,

the better you can see

the bigger picture,

but the small details

fall short on second nature.

&nbsp;

I am not me,

I am all the people I am made of,

I am the past and the unknown,

I am weak and strong,

I am future and expansion,

a galactic neighborhood.

&nbsp;

I am nobody, I am everybody,

I am infinite, I am Omniverse,

I am oblivion, I am emptiness,

I am full of myself,

I am a fool regardless,

I am possibilities,

I am good and a catastrophe.

&nbsp;

I do not deserve nobody,

I do not deserve nobody's pity,

I deserve nothing in this world.

&nbsp;

Everything is given,

you got yourself,

you are everywhere,

you are not a name.

&nbsp;

I am what I imagine,

I am a path, I am faith,

a sentient being

in a pale blue grain.

&nbsp;

I am frames of experiences,

taken from my shallow senses

which only grab a part

infinitely small

of what there is.

&nbsp;

I am God's eyes watching.

&nbsp;

Allegedly I am "alive",

almost just a word,

so it almost has a meaning,

but it is all there is

that we need.
