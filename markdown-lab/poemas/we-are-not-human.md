We are not human,

we are moving beings

who can move upwards

through generations.

&nbsp;

The higher you go,

the better you can see

the bigger picture,

but the small details

fall short on second nature.

&nbsp;

I am not me,

I am all the people I am made of,

I am the past and the unknown,

I am weak and strong,

I am future and expansion,

a galactic neighborhood.

&nbsp;

I am nobody, I am everybody,

I am infinite, I am Omniverse,

I am oblivion, I am emptiness,

I am full of myself,

I am a fool regardless,

I am possibilities,

I am good and a catastrophe.

&nbsp;

I do not deserve nobody,

I do not deserve nobody's pity,

I deserve nothing in this world.

&nbsp;

Everything is given,

you got yourself,

you are everywhere,

you are not a name.

&nbsp;

To live is to decide

which desire you go for.

 

To live is to want and pursue,

but wanting nothing at all

leads to transcend life as is.

 

To finally be yourself

beyond life's meaning,

flow and let go forever.

&nbsp;

I am what I imagine,

I am a path, I am faith,

a sentient being

in a pale blue grain.

&nbsp;

I am frames of experiences,

taken from my shallow senses

which only grab a part

infinitely small

of what there is.

&nbsp;

I am God's eyes watching.

&nbsp;

Allegedly I am "alive",

almost just a word,

so it almost has a meaning.

&nbsp;

I know nothing, but I know

that within the body of All,

there it is, it is there,

and I believe in it.
