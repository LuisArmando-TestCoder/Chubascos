We are not human,

we are moving beings

who can move upwards

through generations.

&nbsp;

The higher you go,

the better you can see

the bigger picture,

but the small details

fall short on second nature.

&nbsp;

I am not me,

I am all the people I am made of,

I am past and the unknown,

I am weak and strong,

I am future and expansion,

a galactic neighborhood.

&nbsp;

I am nobody, I am everybody,

I am infinite, I am Omniverse,

I am oblivion, I am emptiness,

I am full of myself,

I am a fool regardless,

I am possibilities,

I am good and a catastrophe.

&nbsp;

I do not deserve nobody,

I do not deserve nobody’s pity,

I deserve nothing in this world,

everything is given,

everything calls you out to get it,

to live is to decide which one

do you want,

to live is to want,

to live, let go.

&nbsp;

I am what I imagine,

I am a path, I am faith,

a sentient being in a grain of sand.

&nbsp;

I am a frames of experiences,

taken from my shallow senses

which only grab a part

infinitely small

of what there is.

&nbsp;

I am God’s eyes watching.

&nbsp;

Allegedly I am alive,

it is almost just a word,

so it has a meaning.

&nbsp;

I know nothing,

but I know

that within the body of All,

there it is, it is there,

and I believe in it.
