The purpose of life lies in the cycle,

you better enter a cycle

you don't wanna leave,

you better stick to it;

sometimes the cycle

is not going to be the only thing,

but it is going to be yours,

as you are in it,

and you will win a self imposed duty,

to keep spinning the cycle

that you craved to live in.
