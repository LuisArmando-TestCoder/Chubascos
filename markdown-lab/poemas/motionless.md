# Motionless

&nbsp;

The world outside may have been filled with idle chatter and mundane gossip, but inside his heart, there was a storm brewing. A storm that had been raging for years, fueled by pain and heartache. It was a storm that he couldn't contain anymore. And so, he walked into the blacksmith's shop, his eyes devoid of life, his soul consumed by darkness.

&nbsp;

The blacksmith was eating his lunch, oblivious to the impending doom that was about to befall him. Aik didn't look for witnesses, nor did he seek permission. He simply walked towards the swords and the scythes that lay in the corner, and picked them up. He grabbed a belt, a green hood, and a sword sling, and without a word, he walked out of the shop, his heart heavy with sorrow.

&nbsp;

The streets were filled with chaos, screams of terror echoed through the air as soldiers and bandits clashed in a frenzy of blood and steel. But Aik didn't flinch. He walked past the madness, his gaze fixed on the horizon, his mind consumed by thoughts of revenge.

&nbsp;

As he reached the outskirts of the town, a bandit lunged at him with a knife. Aik didn't hesitate. With a swift swing of his scythe, he sliced the man's throat open, blood spilling onto the ground. He took the man's helmet and continued his journey, his heart hardened by the violence that surrounded him.

&nbsp;

For months, he roamed the countryside, a lone figure wielding a scythe and a sword, wreaking havoc on any soldier that crossed his path. His fury was unmatched, his strength unbreakable. He climbed mountains and jumped over ravines, moving with a grace that seemed almost supernatural.

&nbsp;

The stories of his exploits spread like wildfire, and people began to whisper the arrival of a monster, feeding on the blood and flesh of its enemies. Nobody could recall its face, only a couple of anecdotes here and there.

&nbsp;

As the war approached its hundredth year, the soldiers on both sides began to fear him. They knew that he was coming for them, and they knew that they couldn't stop him. He destroyed entire camps, leaving behind a trail of clean cuts, and shocked faces. But in the hundredth year, he stopped.

&nbsp;


&nbsp;

&nbsp;

Aik was not like the other boys in his village. He was different, gifted, and focused beyond his years. He was a fighter, not by choice, but by the burden of his family name. For generations, his family had been war heroes, and the weight of their legacy hung heavily on Aik's shoulders.

&nbsp;

Despite his aversion to violence, Aik had a natural talent for it. He trained day and night, honing his skills with the sword and scythe until he became a force to be reckoned with. And then he met her - the love of his life. She was like a goddess to him, and he was willing to do anything for her.

&nbsp;

As he walked out of the town, his mind drifted to thoughts of her. He loved her with a passion that he couldn't explain. She was his everything, the reason he woke up every morning and the last thought in his head before he fell asleep. She was the only thing that gave him hope in a world that had turned dark and bleak.

&nbsp;

Aik knew that he was a simple man, but his love for her was anything but. It was all-consuming, like a flame that burned deep within his soul. He would do anything for her, even if it meant sacrificing himself in the process.

&nbsp;

Her beauty was like no other, and the sound of her voice was like music to his ears. He could get lost in her eyes for hours, lost in the abyss that was her gaze. She was his calm in the midst of chaos, his light in the darkness.

&nbsp;

As he walked deeper into the forest, he couldn't help but think of her. He yearned for her touch, her kiss, her embrace. He longed to be with her, to feel her warmth against his skin.

&nbsp;

Aik knew that he was a man of few words, but when it came to her, he could write poems that would make the greatest poets envious. She was his everything, and he would do anything to be with her, even if it meant giving up everything he had ever known.

&nbsp;

&nbsp;

As he walked out of his home, his heart racing with worry and fear, he couldn't shake the image of what he had just witnessed. The weight of her crime was too heavy for him to bear. For hours, he paced back and forth in their home, lost in a spiral of despair and confusion.

&nbsp;

As the dawn approached, he knew what he had to do. With a heavy heart and a mind clouded with grief, he made his way to the town square, where he knew he would find the authorities. He confessed everything he had seen, his voice breaking with emotion as he spoke. The soldiers were shocked and sorrowed by what they heard, but they thanked him for coming forward.

&nbsp;

As he walked back to their home, he felt like his heart had shattered into a million pieces.

&nbsp;


&nbsp;

&nbsp;

Aik spent months in a state of complete despair, barely moving from the spot where he had fallen after hearing the news of his beloved's crime. He refused to eat or drink, and his body grew weaker and weaker with each passing day. He felt as though he had lost everything, and that there was nothing left in the world for him.

&nbsp;

As the weeks went by, Aik's situation became more and more dire. He was starving and dehydrated, and his mind was clouded with despair. The only sound that could be heard in his small, dark room was the distant rumbling of market in the distance, and some gossips about him, and the war.

&nbsp;

One day, Aik noticed a small tree growing outside his window. It was a strange tree, with twisted branches and gnarled roots, but it was blooming with fruit. Aik watched as the fruit grew and ripened, and soon it was falling from the tree and rolling into his open mouth.

&nbsp;

For months, the tree provided Aik with the only source of food and liquid he had. He would lie there, motionless, with his mouth open, waiting for the fruit to fall. And when it did, he would chew on it slowly, savouring the taste and the nourishment it provided.

&nbsp;

The tree became Aik's only companion, and he began to feel a strange bond with it. He would talk to it sometimes, telling it about his pain and his sadness, and he felt as though it was listening to him.

&nbsp;

As the months went by, Aik's body began to heal, and he regained some of his strength. But the wicked thoughts started to filter in... so he lied there, listening to the distant sounds and the near demons.

&nbsp;


&nbsp;

&nbsp;

The tree that, lurking outside the window, bore fruit for Aik was no ordinary. Its branches were twisted and gnarled, and its leaves were a sickly shade of green. But despite its sinister appearance, the fruit that it bore was nourishing. Aik couldn't resist the temptation to eat it, even though he knew that there was something off.

&nbsp;

The liquid that he drank from the tree was not water, but a thick, red substance that stained his lips and tongue. At first, when almost statved to death, he didn't mind it. It was sweeter and more potent, the more he drank, and the more he devoured, the less tears he shed. It was a thick dark red substance, slowly draining the sorrow from his heart, replacing it with a hollow numbness.

&nbsp;

With saddened eyes, and dried up tears that once washed the grease of his bony face, he started laughing ironically. "Tastes like iron".

&nbsp;


&nbsp;

&nbsp;

As the nights went on, Aik started having strange dreams about the tree. In his dreams, the tree spoke to him in a voice that was both alluring and sinister, urging him to abandon his cares and forget about the humans who had wronged him. The voice promised him power and freedom, and Aik found himself drawn to it, despite the warning bells ringing in his head.

&nbsp;

In his waking hours, Aik tried to push the dreams out of his mind, but they kept coming back, each one more vivid and seductive than the last.

&nbsp;

But the more he tried to resist, the harder it became. The tree's fruit and liquid had become his sole source of sustenance, and his addiction to it was starting to consume him.

&nbsp;

At some point, he got up, and walked towards the window to grab a fruit on his own, but when he finally reached it, Aik's heart was rushing, he looked at people in the street walking, and felt a supernatural urge to kill them all.

&nbsp;

Quickly hiding, Aik's heart was rushing even more, he waited for hours with his eyes wide open, before slowly standing up and decisively looking with the corner of his eyes, through the corner of the window; someone brushing her hands on an apron, he looked at people's flesh with hunger, not to eat them, only to kill.

&nbsp;

Regardless of all of this, Aik's heart was intact, he knew that this impulse was very very wrong, but at the same time, it felt so seductive, so appealing, so...hypnotic.

&nbsp;

Aik crawled to the corner of the room, and hid there, from the feeling, from fruits, from the voices, rejecting all of them, he and the memory of his monstrous loved one, became one with the walls of the abyss.

&nbsp;


&nbsp;

&nbsp;

As Aik crouched in the corner, he began to see things that weren't there. Ghosts, demons, and all sorts of twisted creatures started to visit him in his mind. They whispered to him, promising him power, pleasure, and release from his pain. They told him that he was better off without the burden of human emotions, that he should embrace his dark desires and revel in his own depravity.

&nbsp;

Aik's mind was filled with their voices, and he couldn't shake them off. They haunted him day and night, urging him to give in to his innermost desires. He started to lose track of time, and he couldn't remember when he had last seen the sun.

&nbsp;

The tree outside his window seemed to grow taller and darker, its branches stretching out like tentacles towards him. Its fruit was no longer nourishing, but instead, it was a poison that was slowly killing him. But he couldn't stop himself from eating it, couldn't stop himself from listening to the voices in his head.

&nbsp;

And so he remained there, trapped in a world of his own making, haunted by his demons, and consumed by his addiction to the twisted tree.

&nbsp;


&nbsp;

&nbsp;

Aik's sense of hearing became more acute as the days passed, and he listened intently to the rumours of foreign wars that filtered in through the window. He started to steer his violent desires towards soldiers, bandits, and mercenaries, convincing himself that it was okay to kill them because they were already killers. He thought that maybe that way, the new guys inside of him, could remain under control, unable to harm any others.

&nbsp;

So he waited, and plotted, and finally, one day, he saw a group of soldiers marching past the window. His heart raced, and he felt the urge to attack. But he controlled himself and waited until they had passed, then he slipped out of the window and followed them from a distance.

&nbsp;

As the sun began to set, the soldiers made camp in a clearing in the forest outside the city walls. Aik watched from the shadows as they ate their dinner, and then he struck. He moved quickly and silently, taking them by surprise. His naked hands flashed in the firelight, and he felt the rush of adrenaline as he fought.

&nbsp;

When it was over, and the soldiers lay dead around him, Aik felt a sense of satisfaction. He had controlled his violent impulses, and he had only killed those who he believed deserved it. As he made his way back to the window, he felt a sense of calm that he hadn't felt in months.

&nbsp;

But the demons were still there, whispering to him, tempting him to kill. And he knew that he would have to be vigilant, to keep them under control, and to continue to only satiate his thirst with what he thought were already killers.

&nbsp;

&nbsp;

Knowing what he did, he entered a crying spree one last time, trying to hold his voices back, trying to starve, he looked for strength everywhere, and he finally saw her in his mind, but soon she turned into a monster, and then he woke up, with one last twisted ray of an idea, he was ready to go to war.

&nbsp;


&nbsp;
## 9

&nbsp;

As Aik walked out of the house, people looked on in shock. They whispered amongst themselves, wondering what could have possibly driven him to such a precarious state.

&nbsp;

As he made his way through the market, people were screaming and running in fear, their faces contorted in terror, lots of bandits were attacking the guards. But the sight of him, emotionless and dead-eyed, with a scythe strapped to his belt and a sword in hand, was enough to make even the bravest of souls, or the stupidest of criminals tremble.

&nbsp;

When a bandit came to attack him, Aik moved with lightning speed, swinging his scythe and slicing the man's throat before he could even react. The other bandits didn't even notice as Aik grabbed the helmet off the dead man's head and continued on his way. He walked past them, without a word, he pulled out his sword and sliced through the throat of one more bandit. And right there, they noticed, the others stared at him in terror, frozen in their tracks. They had never seen such a cold and calculated killing monster, walking so melancholically slow, and yet, ensuring death on its trajectory.

&nbsp;

As Aik walked out of the city gates, his eyes fixed on the horizon, he was no longer the same person. His body was lean, his eyes cold and emotionless. The people who watched him leave, in shock, saw a demonic phoenix rising from the ashes, while wondering what had become of the boy they once knew.

&nbsp;

The once gentle and kind Aik had transformed into a figure that glowed with an otherworldly light that seemed to ripple and writhe with power.

&nbsp;

As he disappeared into the forest, the people of the city remained in stunned silence, unsure of what to do or where to turn. They knew that Aik was no longer the person they once knew, and that his actions would have devastating consequences for everyone involved. But for now, all they could do was watch as the twisted, demonised version of their childhood friend disappeared into the wilderness.

&nbsp;


&nbsp;
## 10

&nbsp;

At first, it was just whispers amongst the soldiers, murmurs of a ghostly figure that appeared out of nowhere and vanished just as quickly. But as time went on, the rumours became more frequent and more terrifying. Entire campaigns were halted, as the troops feared to march any further with the unknown warrior lurking in the shadows. Night after night, he struck with precision and efficiency, slipping into enemy camps undetected and leaving behind a trail of blood and destruction. His attacks came at any hour, leaving the soldiers in a constant state of paranoia and dread. None could stop him, and none knew when he would strike again. The war had already claimed countless lives, but now there was a new force to reckon with, one that even the bravest soldiers cowered in fear of.

&nbsp;


&nbsp;
## 11

&nbsp;

Aik continued on his journey, his only purpose, to find and eliminate anyone who had a business with killing.

&nbsp;

Some whispered that he was possessed by a demon, while others claimed that he had made a deal with the devil. But no one could deny the raw danger that emanated from his presence alone.

&nbsp;

Aik had become a force of nature, beyond human comprehension. So much so, that stories became so twisted, that some of the events were narrated with allegations saying that his eyes glowed a fiery red, that his fingers lengthened into sharp talons, and his hair turned into flames that flickered and danced in the wind, that he spread his wings, and they burst into flames as well, that a trail of fire followed him as he flew higher and higher into the sky, leaving the city far behind, that as he soared through the air, Aik could hear the distant sounds of war drums and the clash of swords, that he landed in a war-torn land, where soldiers and bandits clashed in a deadly dances, that Aik's eyes glowed brighter as he surveyed each scene, that he felt an insatiable hunger, and he knew that he had to feed it with blood, that he swooped down upon the battlefield, his talons ripping through armours and flesh alike, that he fought with a ferocity that no mortal could match, tearing through his enemies with ease, that as the battles raged on, Aik felt his power growing, that the more blood he spilled, the stronger he became, that he fought, day and night, until there were no more enemies left to slay, that he once emerged from the battlefield, his body covered in blood, his eyes glowing with a fierce intensity.

&nbsp;

Aik knew that these were fairy tales, but either way, these were tales about him.

&nbsp;


&nbsp;

&nbsp;

The mysterious man walked into the city pub, and his presence was immediately felt by one of the homemades working there. She couldn't help but notice his cold, dead eyes that seemed to stare straight through her. She felt a shiver run down her spine as he approached the bar.

&nbsp;

The man ordered a drink, and as she served him, the homemade couldn't help but feel a sense of dread wash over her. She knew that this man was dangerous, and that she should stay away from him.

&nbsp;

But there was something else about him that intrigued her. There was a calmness and stillness in his demeanour that was unlike anything she had ever seen. It was as if he had already accepted his fate, and was simply waiting for the end to come.

&nbsp;

As the night went on, the homemade couldn't help but keep an eye on the man. She watched as he sat there quietly, sipping his drink, and occasionally looking up at the other patrons in the pub.

&nbsp;

Despite his calm demeanour, there was something about him that made the homemade feel uneasy. She couldn't quite put her finger on it, but there was a darkness lurking within him that made her skin crawl.

&nbsp;

As the night wore on, the homemade couldn't help but wonder what kind of life this man had lived. She knew that he had seen things that most people could never even imagine, and that he had done things that would haunt him for the rest of his life.

&nbsp;

In the end, the man finished his drink and quietly left the pub, disappearing into the night without a trace. The homemade couldn't help but feel a sense of relief wash over her as he left, knowing that she had narrowly escaped a brush with the darkness that lay within him.

&nbsp;


&nbsp;
## 13

&nbsp;

His movements were fluid, his strikes precise, and his speed unmatched. He moved through the battlefield like a ghost, leaving a trail of bodies in his wake. His enemies whispered of him in fear.

&nbsp;

From the soldier's standpoint, the man was a living nightmare. They had heard rumours of him before, but seeing him in action was a whole different story. He moved with such speed and precision, it was like he was dancing through the battlefield. Soldiers on both sides fell under his blade, and there was no pattern to his attacks. He seemed to strike at random, never staying in one place for too long. Some even whispered that he was a demon, summoned by the enemy to take them all down. But as time went on, it became clear that he didn't discriminate between sides. He was a killing machine, and soldiers learned to fear the mere mention of his name.

&nbsp;


&nbsp;
## 14

&nbsp;

Aik had been wandering through the forest for hours, his mind consumed by his own demons. He was fishing in a nearby stream when he noticed a young boy watching him with wide eyes, curiosity etched on his face.

&nbsp;

At first, Aik was annoyed by the interruption, but something about the boy's innocence and curiosity tugged at his heartstrings. So he put down his fishing pole and turned to face the child.

&nbsp;

"What are you doing here, boy?" Aik asked, his voice gruff and unfriendly.

&nbsp;

The boy took a step closer and looked up at Aik with an innocent expression. "I was just exploring the forest. What are you doing?"

&nbsp;

"I'm fishing," Aik replied, gesturing towards the stream.

&nbsp;

The boy's eyes sparkled with curiosity. "Can I watch?"

&nbsp;

Aik nodded his head in agreement, and the two of them sat in silence as Aik cast his line into the water. The boy watched intently, studying Aik's movements and trying to learn as much as he could.

&nbsp;

After a while, the boy spoke up. "Can I ask you something?"

&nbsp;

Aik grunted in response, not particularly interested in talking.

&nbsp;

The boy continued, undeterred. "Are you sad?"

&nbsp;

Aik was taken aback by the boy's observation. No one had ever noticed his emotions before. He looked at the boy with a hint of surprise and sadness in his eyes.

&nbsp;

The boy, sensing that he had struck a chord with Aik, continued. "My mom always tells me that when I'm feeling sad, it's good to talk about it. Maybe it will help."

&nbsp;

Aik stared at the boy for a moment before sighing heavily. "I'll tell you a story."

&nbsp;

The boy's eyes widened in anticipation, and Aik began his tale. He told the boy about the man who had loved his wife more than anything in the world, and how he had done everything in his power to make her happy. But despite his best efforts, she had still fallen into a deep sadness that he couldn't cure.

&nbsp;

"And then, one day, when the man came home from work, he found out that his wife had done something terrible" Aik finished, his voice filled with pain.

&nbsp;

The boy looked up at Aik with confusion etched on his face. "What did she do?"

&nbsp;

Aik hesitated for a moment before responding, his voice barely above a whisper. "Swung".

&nbsp;

The boy didn't quite understand the meaning behind Aik's words, but he could sense the sadness and pain that lingered in the air. He didn't know what to say, so he simply sat next to Aik, offering him silent support.

&nbsp;

For Aik, the moment was a turning point. It was the first time in a long time that he had opened up to anyone, and it was the first time in even longer that he had allowed himself to feel even the slightest hint of compassion. As the two of them sat there in silence, watching the fish swim in the stream, Aik realised that there was still a spark of humanity left inside of him. And for that, deep inside, he was grateful.

&nbsp;


&nbsp;
## 15

&nbsp;

General Arnald had been overseeing his army's encampment for weeks now. He had set up defensive measures to ensure his soldiers' safety from any surprise attacks. But on this particular morning, chaos erupted in the distance. The sound of screams, clashing swords, and the smell of fire filled the air.

&nbsp;

Arnald quickly mounted his horse and rode towards the commotion. As he got closer, he saw the source of the chaos: a lone warrior swinging a scythe and sword in a deadly dance, cutting down his soldiers. It was the same monster he had heard stories about, the one who had been causing entire campaigns to stop in their tracks.

&nbsp;

Arnald ordered his soldiers to defend their camp, but the monster moved too quickly, slicing through the defences with ease. The general watched in horror as his men fell one by one, unable to keep up with the monster's speed and agility.

&nbsp;

As the sun rose higher in the sky, the monster disappeared back into the forest, leaving a trail of destruction in its wake. Arnald surveyed the aftermath, wondering what kind of creature could wreak such havoc. His enemy was just as confused, having seen the sudden chaos in the distance but unable to make sense of it.

&nbsp;

They would later learn that it was the work of a single warrior, a living nightmare without a heart, who had become a legend on the battlefield. And with each passing day, the stories of his exploits grew more terrifying.

&nbsp;


&nbsp;
## 16

&nbsp;

Aik's journey through the wilderness was filled with moments of darkness and violence, but there were also moments of unexpected humanity.

&nbsp;

One such moment occurred when Aik came across a group of soldiers who had been sent to hunt him down. Aik could sense their fear and hesitation, and he used it to his advantage. He stalked them silently, picking them off one by one, until he managed to make them spread.

&nbsp;

It was then when he noticed a pair of pupils looking at him with horror, hiding in the bushes. It was one of the soldiers, but he was different from the others. He was young, and his eyes were filled with terror, watching the whole scene unfold. Aik could see himself reflected in the young man's pupils, and for a moment, he hesitated.

&nbsp;

Aik jumped and stumbled on the ground in front of the man, the other soldiers were running. "Are you willing to kill?" the monster asked, as the afraid soldier remained stuttering in a mute cry. Aik grabbed the scythe, looking steadily at the young man, put it in his hands and asked once again: "Are you willing to kill a monster? You are a human".

&nbsp;

The young soldier was frozen, unsure of what to do. Aik watched him carefully, waiting for his answer. Finally, the soldier shook his head, rejecting the idea of taking a life, tears streaming down his face.

&nbsp;

Aik took the scythe out of the man's hands and said, while walking past the soldier on his knees, "You don't belong here".

&nbsp;

He left the soldier alive, knowing that he could never go back to his comrades after failing to capture or kill the monster when given the opportunity in silver plate.

&nbsp;

As Aik walked away, he felt a glimmer of hope. Maybe there was still some humanity left in him, after all.

&nbsp;


&nbsp;
## 17

&nbsp;

Aik had been travelling for months, wandering from one kingdom to another, his heart heavy with the weight of his past. He had left his home and everything he had ever known behind, driven by a need to escape the pain of his lost love and the burden of a sin he didn't commit.

&nbsp;

One day, he stumbled upon a village on the brink of war. The air was thick with tension and the sound of swords clashing could be heard in the distance. Aik felt a pull towards the chaos, a sense of purpose that he had not felt in months.

&nbsp;

Aik entered, his eyes dead and his mind made up. He didn't bother to look for witnesses, didn't even spare a glance at nobody but the horizon, he kept walking forward through a stampede of scared villagers running in the opposite direction, while striding purposefully towards the town entrance.

&nbsp;

As he emerged onto the streets, chaos was erupting all around him. Soldiers and mercenaries fought, stealing and killing without a second thought. Aik didn't even flinch, didn't even pause to consider his next move. He walked straight through the melee, his eyes fixed on the horizon.

&nbsp;

One of the soldiers saw him and charged, but Aik was way faster. He swung his scythe out from his belt and sliced the man's head into the sky. As the body hit the ground, Aik snatched a fruit from a tree and kept moving, his heart pounding with adrenaline, but his mind at ease.

&nbsp;

Suddenly, Aik stopped, and stepped back all the way towards the landing position of the head he had snapped out, he catched it, and started looking at it steadily, and then kneeled; everybody else had already a fighting partner, and honestly, maybe they preferred fighting each other than getting closer to that mentally deranged looking assassin, maybe even because he was citing a story to a head, in the middle of that battlefield, and he was petting it.

&nbsp;

"This monster was once a man, and that man had a wife, she was the most important person in his life, but she also suffered from severe sadness; he always made sure to make her feel loved, and heard, she also liked him like wonders, as she cried every time he went out to work, and so, every speck of spare time he had available, he gave it to her, on a perpetual exercise to bring her happiness, because, deep in his soul, that is how he felt around her, even though he never told her, he didn't think it was necessary, but he definitely knew how to hold her tightly, every night and every encounter, and still, that day came, when the man got back to his home, and she had committed a crime so unspeakable, he forgot it even happened! But one day, after so much travelling, he remembered, she had killed someone, no other than the most important person in this man's life, and then hung it on a tree".

&nbsp;

In the hundredth year, when the war stopped, Aik was found in his motherland, peacefully asleep under a tree.
