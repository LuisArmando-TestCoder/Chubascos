In oblivion you get tested,

because the freedom

of not being watched

displays

what you truly are,

just like power amplifies

your identity.

&nbsp;

What you do in secret

is going to shape you

in the long run.

&nbsp;

What does your spare time

look like?

&nbsp;

How do you describe

the shape of the grain details

of your life?

&nbsp;

When you are truly free,

when you are being

forgotten by society,

when you escape

the need for acceptance,

when you are one

with no other body,

your actions show in handsight

your real testament.

&nbsp;

Lonely gods do not hide,

so what type of god is there,

awaiting within?
