Tired of looking for love.

&nbsp;

My room, pretty dark

at three o'clock.

&nbsp;

Pain endures so much,

but so do I,

as the weight

of both of my eye socks.

&nbsp;

Pain pushes;

my fingers type.

&nbsp;

If not with letters,

then with the language of art.

&nbsp;

See, I have an ache

for a hole in my chest;

insurance won't cover,

I bet on my life

and future pills.

&nbsp;

Bloodsuckers;

thirst for my soul,

but I'm hollow,

and hopeless,

and helpless,

and filling the gaps

by pursuing my dreams.

&nbsp;

What a hypocrite,

I'm not empty,

but full,

wishful indeed,

for a life better than this.

&nbsp;

In which I'm not

a seizuring blob.

&nbsp;

I knew all along

I was broken,

from the instant I said:

I'm sorry to exist.

&nbsp;

Sorry that you don't get

how much I do care,

so much so,

I'm stepping away

from everything.

&nbsp;

The more broken the heart,

the louder the cheers,

in which they scream:

kill yourself, bitch.

&nbsp;

A legion of voices

spitting on me.

&nbsp;

I desire to meet somebody

that holding this wish

caresses away,

vapor of tears.

&nbsp;

Hold or being held;

I can trade our affection,

as easy as it seems.

&nbsp;

I drown in depression.

I'm crawling away,

at midnight; the sink,

the mirror, the ghost,

nobody sees.

&nbsp;

All of my demons

are laughing at me;

my need for a spec of a kiss.

&nbsp;

I hear laughs

becoming like rain,

becoming a storm,

intolerable,

misery that

I cannot hold.

&nbsp;

Only a prince

could ever be loved.

&nbsp;

Only a prince,

betrayed by the thought:

do they love me,

or love my facade?.

&nbsp;

From paranoia,

a prince could just die,

bursting inside,

but on my side,

of hypothermia,

sadness is vile.

&nbsp;

Poems, help me;

I want to agonize,

but peacefully,

while trying to kill

the man in the mirror.

&nbsp;

I'm afraid of being hated,

for terrified of being honest.

&nbsp;

I'm afraid of being laughed at

by all of those sadness deniers.

&nbsp;

I'm just a lyricist,

afraid of sharing.

&nbsp;

I'm afraid I'll care too much,

even though I want not caring.

&nbsp;

I'm really freaking tired

of looking for a place

where I truly don't belong.

&nbsp;

I now just want to close my eyes

until the dawn and beyond.

&nbsp;

I promised I'll survive the fall,

but I've jumped quite high.
