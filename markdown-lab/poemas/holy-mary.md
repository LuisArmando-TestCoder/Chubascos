Holy Mary, those holy eyes, 

you are a menace to humankind.

&nbsp;

Holy Mary, you aren't kind, 

one of those girls that drive me wild.

&nbsp;

Holy Mary, I cannot stop 

looking at those precious eyes.

&nbsp;

Crazy Mary, you are so wild;

free spirit that drives me mad.

&nbsp;

She was a virgin, I didn't know, 

I desecrated; I think I'm bad.

&nbsp;

Holy Mary, I cannot stop;

girl so tasty, girl you are.

&nbsp;

A fallen angel looking at 

dirty Mary's precious eyes.

&nbsp;

My dear Mary, what am I?

a fallen angel; pretty lies.
