Holy Mary, those holy eyes.

&nbsp;

You're menace to humankind,

free spirit that drives me wild.

&nbsp;

Holy Mary, you aren't kind.

&nbsp;

Holy Mary, I cannot stop.

&nbsp;

Crazy Mary, you are so wild.

&nbsp;

She was virgin, I think I'mÂ bad.

&nbsp;

Holy Mary, I cannot stop.

&nbsp;

Fallen angel I'm looking at.

&nbsp;

My dear Mary, what am I?
