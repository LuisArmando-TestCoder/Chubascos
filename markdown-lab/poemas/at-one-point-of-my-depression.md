At one point of my depression,

I found enlightenment,

which made me feel less pain,

and less excitement,

because I have seen

and felt so much.

&nbsp;

Haven't felt real pain

in a while,

but, I am not nostalgic anymore,

so, I'm not missing it.

&nbsp;

If I'm at ease,

why would I suffer?

&nbsp;

I feel cymbals

when touching art

or an authentic person

comes up to me.
