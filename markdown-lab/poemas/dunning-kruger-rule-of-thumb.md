Dunning Kruger rule of thumb.

&nbsp;

If a non expert

is feeling all mighty,

most likely

we call that

an idiot

with a loose tongue.

&nbsp;

If a person

feels like an impostor,

most likely knows a lot,

because of understanding

its own ignorance,

which takes exploring

the intended

the Valley of the Unknown.

&nbsp;

If a cultured one is amazed

of its own knowledge,

we most likely

have an expert

in front of us.
