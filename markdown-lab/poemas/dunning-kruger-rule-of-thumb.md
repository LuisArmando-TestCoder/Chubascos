Dunning Kruger rule of thumb.

&nbsp;

If somebody

feels like an impostor,

most likely knows a lot.

&nbsp;

If a cultured one is amazed

of its own knowledge,

we most likely

have an expert

in front of us.

&nbsp;

If a non expert

is feeling all mighty,

most likely

we call that

an idiot

with a loose tongue.
