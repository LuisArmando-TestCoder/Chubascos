Am I floating,

Into the Sun?

Or is it just me,

My tears are warm?

&nbsp;

Rest In Peace

Quiet days,

Let me die

On your chest.

&nbsp;

Didn’t my eyes

Belong to my face,

Why can't I then

Pause my stare?

&nbsp;

I’m lost in pupils,

Hollow,

On this dead bed

I’m lost in irises.

&nbsp;

I hope for the dawn,

Of your tenderness

And I’m so numb,

I'm deranged.

&nbsp;

Am I the blaze?

I’m insane

on your skin,

Is this the sun?

&nbsp;

Take my fingers

Make them crawl

Further than

Any human

Has ever gone

On your skin.

&nbsp;

Good bye thoughts,

I don't need you all,

I just need to sink.

Hoping

For my tender…

My sweet dawn.
