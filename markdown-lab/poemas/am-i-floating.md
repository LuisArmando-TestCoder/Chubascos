Am I floating,

Into the Sun?

Or is it just me,

My tears are warm?

&nbsp;

Rest In Peace

Quiet days,

Let me die

On your chest.

&nbsp;

Didn’t my eyes

Belong to my face,

Why can't I then

Pause my stare?

&nbsp;

I’m lost in pupils,

Hollowness,

On this dead bed

Lost in irises.

&nbsp;

I hope for the dawn,

Of your tenderness

And I’m so numb,

I'm deranged.

&nbsp;

Am I the blaze?

I’m insane,

Is this the sun?

Is it your skin?

&nbsp;

Take my fingers

Make them crawl,

On the surface

Of the Sun,

That's boiling

In its touch.

&nbsp;

Take my fingers

Make them crawl,

Further than

Any skin

Has ever gone.

&nbsp;

Good bye thoughts,

I don't need you anymore,

I need to sink,

Into the dawn.
