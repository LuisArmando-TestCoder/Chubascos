Boys are just like girls,

cuz we love so freaking hard,

we get deceived in darkness

when someone is our light.

&nbsp;

A young guy once cried,

then kept it to himself,

cuz he loved so freaking hard

and didn't own his chest.

&nbsp;

Everytime he looked at her,

her heart started pounding,

but both were young and fearful,

of the kind that tastes so well,

but she kept it to herself too,

just as he did with her.

&nbsp;

Everytime he wondered

his heart started pounding,

and when she looked at him

he could glare a halo;

that was bittersweet,

seeing that much halo,

being close to it

and yet so far away.

&nbsp;

Boys are just like girls,

cuz we love so freaking hard,

we get deceived in darkness

when someone is our light.

&nbsp;

They told their oldest friends,

and they were so surprised,

someone could really care much,

and both could wear a halo,

and both were deeply in love,

fearing not being smiled back,

and a smile was not enough

but freaking more than

what they both could take.
