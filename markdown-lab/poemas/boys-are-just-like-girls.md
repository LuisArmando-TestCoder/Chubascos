Boys are just like girls,

cuz we love so hard,

get deceived in darkness,

someone is our lighthouse.

&nbsp;

A young guy once cried,

then kept it to himself,

cuz he loved freaking hard

and didn't own his chest,

he didn't own his chest.

&nbsp;

Everytime he looked at her,

her heart started pounding,

but both were young and fearful,

of the kind that tastes so well,

but she kept it to herself too,

that was such a shame.

&nbsp;

Everytime she looked at him,

his heart started pounding,

and that was so bittersweet,

seeing that much halo,

being close to it

and yet far away.

&nbsp;

Boys are just like girls,

cuz we love so hard,

get deceived in darkness,

someone is our lighthouse.

&nbsp;

They told their oldest friends,

they were so surprised,

someone really cared,

both could wear a halo,

both were deeply in love,

fearing not being smiled back,

nut a smile was not enough,

but so freaking more

than what they both could take.
