Boys are just like girls,

cuz we love so hard,

get deceived in darkness

when someone is our light

and we loose that one.

&nbsp;

A young guy once cried,

then kept it to himself,

cuz he loved so hard

he didn't own his chest.

&nbsp;

Everytime she looked at him,

her heart started pounding,

both were young and fearful

of the kind that tastes sweet,

she kept it to herself.

&nbsp;

Everytime he looked at her,

his heart started pounding,

and that was so bittersweet,

seeing that much halo,

being close to her

and yet so far away.

&nbsp;

Boys are just like girls,

cuz we love so hard,

get deceived in darkness

when someone is our light

and we loose that one.

&nbsp;

They told all their friends,

they were so surprised,

someone really cared,

for someone outside of self.

&nbsp;

Both could wear a halo,

both were deeply in love,

fearing the absence of

a tiny pitty smile,

but is not enough,

but so freaking more

than what they could take;

that was such a shame,

cuz they were way more

than just two good friends.
