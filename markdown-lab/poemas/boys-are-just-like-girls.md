Boys are just like girls,

cuz we love so freaking hard,

we get deceived in dark

and someone is our light.

&nbsp;

A young guy once cried,

then kept it to himself,

cuz he loved so freaking hard

and didn't own his chest.

&nbsp;

Everytime he looked at her,

her heart wanted to jump

out of her to his arms,

but both were young and fearful,

of the kind that tastes so sweet,

but she kept it to herself,

just as he did with her,

it was such a shame.

&nbsp;

Everytime he wondered

his heart started pounding,

and when she looked at him

he could glare a halo;

that was bittersweet,

seeing that much halo,

being close to it

and yet so far away.

&nbsp;

Boys are just like girls,

cuz we love so freaking hard,

we get deceived in dark

and someone is our light.

&nbsp;

They told their oldest friends,

and they were so surprised,

someone could care that much,

and both could wear a halo,

and both were deeply in love,

fearing not being smiled back,

and a smile was not enough

but way more than what they could take.
