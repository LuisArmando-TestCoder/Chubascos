Boys are just like girls,

cuz we so love hard,

and we get deceived

when we our lost in dark,

when someone is light.

&nbsp;

A young guy once cried,

and kept it to himself,

cus he loved so hard

and didn't own his chest.

&nbsp;

Everytime she looked at him,

her heart wanted to scape,

and run into his arms,

but both were young in fear,

of the kind that tastes so sweet,

but she kept it to herself.

&nbsp;

Everytime he wondered

his heart started pounding,

and when she looked at him

he could glare a halo;

that was bittersweet,

seeing that much heaven,

being close to it,

and yet so far away.

&nbsp;

They told their oldest friend,

and they were so surprised

that a guy and girl

could care so much for one another,

and meant each other the world,

and both could wear a halo,

and both were deeply,

fearing not being loved back,

and none said but a smile,

and a smile was not enough

but way more than what both could take.
