The ones that are worth it

are meant to be loved authentically,

to balance out

how lonely they might be feeling

in that peak of existence

that they sit on,

they are hallucinating,

even though somebody might tell them:

"how can you feel lonely,

if you are surrounded by the Everything,

isn't this your chance to take it?".

And as they hear that,

they'll start imagining.
