Something is very wrong with this world, well, there are many things, but there is one in particular, very subtle, like a slight poison in the food that goes unnoticed, like sugar, which is so casual that now we are addicted, surrounded by this drug; even in universities, politics, the stories we consume, show businesses, and social media, almost everyone preaches its use, and they don't even know it, and they don't even know it's killing them.

&nbsp;

But who am I to preach something… A nobody. So many would say.

&nbsp;

And there it is, the drug has just appeared again, and you didn’t even notice. Maybe.

&nbsp;

The reason for my multiple relapses, the reason why I feel subtly uncomfortable because if there's one thing I have, it's sensitivity to feel incomplete. Every time a pit opens in my stomach, I feel it, but what sets me apart is that I don't ignore it. I look at the abyss, and the abyss stares back, and then back I stare steadily.

&nbsp;

Let's get to the point: I don't want to be, I want to do. But why is this the reason for so many of my dilemmas?

&nbsp;

There is a quite ironic syndrome I remember with nostalgia, one that I suffered from. Instead of simply naming it, I'll give it a name of my own, just like I tend to like to do; I call this syndrome: I became my dream, and now I feel empty.

&nbsp;

Let's start at the end. Once, a boxer got what he wanted, he became the heavyweight undisputed world champion, and at the time, he was immensely happy for a moment, but days later, he returned to his place and thought, "Do I want to keep fighting? Should I retire?"

&nbsp;

And after a few weeks of consideration, he came up with his answer: "Of course! Now that I'm printed in history, I'm free to do whatever I want!"

&nbsp;

But to me, the soul of that boxer secretly said: "I've spent too much time imprisoned by my egotism. It's time to do what I really want."

&nbsp;

Right there! Right there, right there he felt joy, but the egotism inside him woke up. I mean, who wouldn't in the face of a threat of death? Who wouldn't defend themselves if they could, from their captor? As ego fell captive of a mind that was about to assassinate it.

&nbsp;

Then the ego took the reins of that champion's inner voice. "But who am I if I don't box, who am I if I'm not the champion, who would I be? Nobody."

&nbsp;

And with a shiver, the brain of that great boxer, crowded, sank him on the couch; the buried boxer thought, "Yes, if I'm not the champion, I'm nothing...But, I don't know what to do." And after that phrase, he left out a last idea that he didn't even know how to express, so I'll express it for him: "I don't want to box anymore, but I don't have another option, so damn, I feel trapped again." And right there, I have to stop.

&nbsp;

I too have felt imprisoned; not when I was going for my goal, but when I had already achieved it. I've seen my eyes in others, living a dream they no longer want to live, and I exemplify it this way. You are in an amusement park, you get on one of the rides, and you realize you can't get off. But hold on… why? And again, there's a clue, right there, in the piece that doesn't fit. Why can't you get off?

&nbsp;

First, we have to break down the example of the “amusement park’s machine” into its realistic counterparts.

&nbsp;

The amusement park is life.

&nbsp;

The machine is the experience of being.

&nbsp;

Not getting off the machine is to repeat its experience indefinitely.

&nbsp;

And what I feel when I think about it, is pure terror, because I know, deep down, that a person is not defined by an experience of being.

&nbsp;

That's why I'm terrified of being pigeonholed into a profession, a title, an expectation, a last name. "But that's the harsh reality." Or that's what some would say, some who call themselves realists, without realizing that the act of labeling oneself twists their personality until it becomes cynical; "it is what it is"; "that's life."

&nbsp;

And here begins my subtle discomfort, with its uncomfortable subtlety, because sometimes I tend to think so logically that it almost resembles breathing, and when something doesn't fit, it bothers me, so much so that I have to wake up, turn my face away, take it with disgust from the corners, and with effort catapult it overboard.

&nbsp;

If people say, "that's life." It's not that's how life is, it's that's how they believe life is... But why?

&nbsp;

Because that's one of the pieces of interpretation of reality that was instilled in them. And what does that piece say exactly?

&nbsp;

Well, you have to listen carefully because they announce it continuously.

&nbsp;

"Do you want to be?". "Be." "You want to be."

&nbsp;

Doubt is implanted in you, and before you arrive at an answer, they put their own answer ahead of you, and then demand it of you.

&nbsp;

"To be." The world bleeds out for a single term, and the wound has gangrene.

&nbsp;

Even so, this is not all, there is a clue that points to a particular hope.

&nbsp;

When the boxer felt completely fulfilled for a moment, just before the ego intervened, he felt happy even though he had not achieved anything in that context to deserve such happiness, except that he gained understanding; he obtained security for his future; he knew what lay ahead; and he was excited. All this because he said to himself, "...I'm free to do whatever I want."

&nbsp;

And there it is. That's what was missing; freedom. I lacked freedom because I thought I had to be what I set out to be; even though I didn't want to be it anymore, because I had already been it, I'm a collector of experiences, why do I need a repeated card?

&nbsp;

I didn't feel empty because I had achieved my dream, but because I had chained myself to repeating it. That's why "to be" is the poison that feeds us and makes us addicted when all we want is not to think about what we are but to do what we want.

&nbsp;

Defining ourselves is what "to be" achieves, and that's the ego, an interpretation of your own person. And we are surrounded by ads that incite us to drug ourselves, to take a mirror, and lie to ourselves in the eyes.

&nbsp;

We can use our free time to do whatever we want, and that's what freedom looks like, and freedom is comfortable; it can even be in pursuing a dream, even if that dream is not who we are, the fact that we pursued it at some point is just a piece in the puzzle of our story, and in our story, there is us.

&nbsp;

That's why I don't want to "be," even though when they think of me, they only think of a biography or a word, and I can't stop them from naming it, I refuse to define myself; I'm not alive to fit into a description of a person, and I didn't choose to be born to be bossed around by expectations.

&nbsp;

I was put on this Earth without my consent, so they'll have to deal with it, because I do what I want, for I am not a noun.
