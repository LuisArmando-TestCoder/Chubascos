The tip of my finger 

comes from the sand.

&nbsp;

I wish I was fearless, 

I’m buried alive.

&nbsp;

I follow a something 

absurd in my life.

&nbsp;

Spending the minutes,

a big whole of time.

&nbsp;

My present sentencing

past will despise.

&nbsp;

All of your voices 

won't mind to stay.

&nbsp;

Edges I’ve sharpened,

the corners of mind.

&nbsp;

Feeling like dust,

clay keeping up.

&nbsp;

Fake living life.

&nbsp;

Fake being the woke.

&nbsp;

Fake feeling love.

&nbsp;

Is hard to distinguish 

my auto mode.

&nbsp;

Sticking my finger

back in my soul.

&nbsp;

Still breathing chill.

&nbsp;

Nice memories, 

pain killer pills.

&nbsp;

I cared of my acts,

feeling disrupted.

&nbsp;

Nobody saves them,

you save yourself.

&nbsp;

Nobody saves them,

you save your gaze.

&nbsp;

I feel like I’m breathing.

&nbsp;

Lonely and lovely.

&nbsp;

Undress my shine.

&nbsp;

For a millionth time

I try to be the one.

&nbsp;

Legendary abyss,

rabbit hole ecstasy,

Challenger Deep.

&nbsp;

I’m coming out alive.

&nbsp;

I came out surprising.

&nbsp;

I turned out an angel.

&nbsp;

I challenge my ravs.

&nbsp;

Leaving my house

feeling I’m stronger.

&nbsp;

Nobody told me

which one was goodness.

&nbsp;

So I’m living the life

I guess, 

would feel the proudest.
