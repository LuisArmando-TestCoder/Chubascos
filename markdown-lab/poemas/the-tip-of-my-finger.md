The tip of my finger 

comes from the sand.

&nbsp;

I wish I was fearless, 

I’m buried alive.

&nbsp;

I follow a something 

absurd in my life.

&nbsp;

Me, spending minutes,

a big whole of time.

&nbsp;

My present sentencing

past will despise.

&nbsp;

All of your voices 

wouldn't mind to stay.

&nbsp;

Edges I’ve sharpened,

the corners of mind.

&nbsp;

Feeling like dust,

clay keeping up.

&nbsp;

Fake living life.

&nbsp;

Fake waking up.

&nbsp;

Fake feeling love.

&nbsp;

Is hard to distinguish 

my auto mode.
