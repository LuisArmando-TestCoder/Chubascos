Why would you say sorry, if I'm not mad about it? We are sand and stories, chattering scenarios; we forgot this was a game, we are trippin NPCs that took it way too personal, like life is about us, but life is not; I'm not mad at all.

&nbsp;

I wasn't expecting a thing, I'm prepared for all my dreams; within nightmares I'm cool, why would I bad trip or get disturbed?

&nbsp;

I'm not missing feeling things, cuz I feel it coming with a masterpiece.

&nbsp;

I'm not bored at all, within silence and within noise I feel complete.

&nbsp;

So greet me please; thank me, if you want, my dear.

&nbsp;

Don't ask me for forgiveness, when you're already forgiven.

&nbsp;

In the first place, I'm a nobody ghostly living, pain feels foreign, like it was part of a distant dream, so you didn't hurt me, nay.

&nbsp;

Hey, it was like a breeze and I'm still breathing.

&nbsp;

So I'm ok, and I keep living in this muzzy world, with my jazzy soul, snazzy lounge, pizzazzy whole, I'm whole, but thank you for your feelings.
