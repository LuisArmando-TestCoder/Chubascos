If your words

you chew too much,

these will vanish

in your mouth.

&nbsp;

You want to be understood,

which is having faith

in someone else's

interpretation of reality.

&nbsp;

But nobody understands,

you empathize with yourself

to circumvent

ego's veil,

what if you have an ego

for each one of them?

&nbsp;

What if,

you never understood nobody

outside of yourself?

Aren't they a simulation within?

&nbsp;

How are you going

to be guided out

of your own fog,

if not, with words?

&nbsp;

Raw words, decorated ones,

ones, undervalued,

and the flavored ones,

wasted.

&nbsp;

I'm trying to find

the perfect balance

between memorable

and beauteous.
