Sometimes love is not that profound,

as one falls for a mirage

when there is no sound.

&nbsp;

One wishes one's hands

kept molding that soft surface

and those curved lines.

&nbsp;

One will insist on refining

with its own fingerprints,

slowly,

what is already perfect.

&nbsp;

One's superficial awareness

becomes deeper,

and like a meteor shower,

one will go through an abyss

and fall to their encounter,

to look for an instant

at a wonder, in that person.

&nbsp;

One might become bewitched and spellbound;

romantic and full of platitudes,

how wouldn't one?

That sight opens a chance of us.

&nbsp;

We are looking for someone

to read aloud to

the glyphs of these verses.

&nbsp;

We have been waiting to liberate

all of these captive love letters

inside of us.
