Sometimes love is not that profound,

one falls for a mirage when there is no sound.

&nbsp;

One wishes oneâ€™s hands

kept molding that soft drawing

and those curved lines,

one will insist on refining

with its own fingerprints,

slowly,

what is already perfect.

&nbsp;

Like a meteor shower,

one will fall for their encounter,

to look for an instant at a wonder.

&nbsp;

One might become enchanted,

romantic and full of platitudes,

as that is the door that opens

for every chance of us.

&nbsp;

We are looking for someone

to read aloud to our glyphs of love.
