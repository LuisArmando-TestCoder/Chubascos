I replied:

"I have read it,

but it doesn't matter,

the only thing that matters

is applying the knowledge

I was given".

&nbsp;

"Yes!", the voice replied,

so I stared back,

but the look in my eyes

didn't hold any positivity within,

so then, scared and in secrecy,

his mind became foggy and storming,

building possible outcomes.

&nbsp;

"Is he mad at me?",

I said, mimicking his demeanor.

&nbsp;

"Did you just read my mind?",

he laughed in a puzzled awe.

&nbsp;

So I kept going:

"You are not looking in my eyes,

you are strategizing

how to avoid conflict

and/or get the best outcome,

while coming out unharmed and proudful,

but I forgive you,

as that is the so-called veil

by which so many

get infected by

in the later stages

of their childhood.

&nbsp;

Get rid of everything you know,

so you understand what you don't,

be ready to be surprised or not,

be ready for what might come

and what might not.

&nbsp;

My lack of expressions

makes you wonder in a split second:

``what is this response?

could it be that he is mad at me?

If he was, that would make sense,

and if that makes sense,

that is likely to be true,

and if that is likely to be true,

I will make it my safe truth``.

&nbsp;

But the machinery

keeps going on and on:

``then, it doesn't make sense!

Why is he mad in the first place?

Was it me or someone else?

Is he passing through some ache?``.

&nbsp;

Easy, I'm flowing,

which means

that I'm not forcing myself

into any sort of

acquired character's

stereotypical answers.

&nbsp;

There is no

`\`should or shouldn't`\`

in my virtual list of manners,

just my natural sense of rightfulness.

&nbsp;

So my actions are my will

sinking in the Sea of Time.

&nbsp;

I'm not mad at you.

&nbsp;

I'm free to not look enlightened.

&nbsp;

I don't have to fit

anybody's code of conduct,

nor the acceptance of the world

that I'm part of.

&nbsp;

I'm open to being wrong

and changing my subjective wrong doings

for the sake of a subjective enhacement.

&nbsp;

I'm open to hardheadedness

and sticking to my made up

dozen commandments.

&nbsp;

But I, at all costs,

accept my consistency,

accept my changes

and my made up destiny,

and that is enough,

as I am connected to

Everything.

&nbsp;

So, now that I told you all of this,

let me tell you once again:

no, I'm not mad at you,

nor at anyone else".
