Gotta say it once

and as many times

and stay it once

and once and for all.

 

Is tiring to pursue

meanings of absurds.

 

What an absurd life.

 

What an absurd life.

 

Is tiring to pursue

being a good cop,

I do not really want

being bad at all.

&nbsp;

Lying many proverbs

on each of my bed times.

 

What an absurd life.

 

What an absurd life.

 

Sure to end my life,

but I'm not sure at all,

I have not tasted yet

being the shining melt.

 

So it's time to break,

make our scars our way.
