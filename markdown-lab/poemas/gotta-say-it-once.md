Gotta say it once

and as many times

and stay it once

and once and for all.

&nbsp;

Is tiring to pursue

meanings of absurds.

&nbsp;

What an absurd life.

&nbsp;

What an absurd life.

&nbsp;

Is tiring to pursue

being a good cop,

I do not really want

being bad at all.

&nbsp;

Lying many proverbs

on each of my bed times.

&nbsp;

What an absurd life.

&nbsp;

What an absurd life.

&nbsp;

Sure to end my life,

but I'm not sure at all,

I have not tasted yet

being the shining melt.

&nbsp;

So it's time to break,

make our scars our way.
