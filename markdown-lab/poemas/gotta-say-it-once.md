Gotta say it once

and as many times

and stay it once

and once and for all.

 

Is tiring to pursue

meanings of absurds.

 

What an absurd life.

 

What an absurd life.

 

Is tiring to pursue

being a bad cop,

I do not really want

to be the good one.

&nbsp;

I am lying many proverbs

on each bed time.

 

What an absurd life.

 

What an absurd life.

 

Sure to end my life,

but I'm not sure at all,

I have not tasted yet

to be the melting pot.

 

So it's time to break,

make our scars our way.
