I see the Devil disappointed.

"Not my hoax", he said, sourly.

&nbsp;

"Look at them sleeping

look at them daydreaming,

death skin and flies,

with wide open rottened eyes.

&nbsp;

Shatterable lives,

fragile and wise.

&nbsp;

Flashing lights

erasing their memories.

&nbsp;

Are they holding Pandora,

or is she holding them.

&nbsp;

Madness in unison

and not by my hand.

&nbsp;

At the end they were

as arrogant as I am.

&nbsp;

God made us,

my brothers,

in His own image and

after His own likeness.

&nbsp;

Waking up with demon eyes,

but they are not my army.

&nbsp;

They are sitting at dinner

with the reflection of madness

in their irises, ashes.

&nbsp;

Their oblivion

was not my plan,

but at the end

it is expected

from who didn't ask

to exist in the first place.

&nbsp;

Their shrine lies rotten

as they gave themselves

to games and pleasure,

in exchange for vices.

&nbsp;

Who would have thought

they will take revenge

of their own actions

by punishing themselves

by not moving; no pain,

just a spirit screaming.

&nbsp;

What a torture that one is,

I never thought about it.

&nbsp;

While the good ones

just need to walk

across freezed a civilization.

&nbsp;

Only for their arrogance

and disregard for the other

have they found themselves

rottened in the shrine

of their own consciousness".

&nbsp;

And God is mourning,

because in the end,

they didn't want to live

their own stories,

they wanted to live

someone else's.
