I see the Devil disappointed.

"Not my hoax", he said, sourly.

&nbsp;

"Look at them sleeping

look at them daydreaming,

death skin and flies,

with wide open rottened eyes.

&nbsp;

Shatterable lives,

fragile and wise.

&nbsp;

Madness in unison

and not by my hand.

&nbsp;

At the end they were

as arrogant as I am.

&nbsp;

God made us, my brothers.

&nbsp;

Waking up with demon eyes,

but they are not my army.

&nbsp;

Their shrine lies rotten

as they gave themselves

to pleasure and vices.

&nbsp;

What a torture that one is,

I never thought about it".
