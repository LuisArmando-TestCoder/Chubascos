A blue whistling thrush is singing;

these songs belong to you.

&nbsp;

I think all this creation;

love letter just for you.

&nbsp;

How could I express the brightness

that’s coming all from you?

&nbsp;

Oh, Universe of wonders,

the best of them are you.

&nbsp;

You can cry, you want it;

my arms around you too.

&nbsp;

I love you like a lightning;

stopping time for you.

&nbsp;

You are light in darkness,

don’t fear, I'll walk with you.

&nbsp;

People would be amazed if

they see all you can do.

&nbsp;

You could be amazed if 

you keep just walking through.
