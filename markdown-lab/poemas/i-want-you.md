I want you

to take time for you,

Fuck and fight,

Nevermind,

Blew my mind,

Guess that I,

Headshot I,

Shot my plans

In the head,

Rest In Peace

To my quiet days.

&nbsp;

Keep me warm

Catch my breath,

Mastermind,

Good bye thoughts,

I’m awake,

But too numb to

Run away.

&nbsp;

Are you a demon or my death?

Succubus or a wise black dog

In two feet.

&nbsp;

Why am I being dragged,

Didn’t I had my eyes,

Why do I still stare,

like I’m lost

in pupils?

&nbsp;

Keep me warm

Catch my breath,

Mastermind,

Good bye thoughts,

I’m awake,

But too numb to

Run away.
