I want you

To take time

For you, so you

Fuck and fight.

&nbsp;

Nevermind,

Blew my mind,

Guess that I,

Headshot I,

Shot my plans

In the head,

Rest In Peace

To my quiet days.

&nbsp;

Keep me warm

Catch my breath,

Good bye thoughts,

I’m awake,

But too numb to

Run away.

&nbsp;

Are you a demon or my death?

Succubus or a wise black dog

In two feet.

&nbsp;

Why am I being dragged,

Didn’t I had my eyes,

Why do I still stare,

like I’m lost

in pupils?

&nbsp;

Keep me warm

Catch my breath,

Good bye thoughts,

I’m awake,

But too numb to

Run away.
