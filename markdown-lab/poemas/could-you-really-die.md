Could you really die? 

Never really alive.

&nbsp;

Were you 

really breathing,

while so 

dead inside?

&nbsp;

Watch the 

bold fake faith.

&nbsp;

Sweating

eating gum,

cross marked 

back face,

fake faith bath.

&nbsp;

Left by by religion,

could you really die?

almost dead inside,

would you 

really breathe?

&nbsp;

Actions through

the thoughts;

crystal amber lead;

Matrix oracle.

&nbsp;

From my solar plexus

I will share my thoughts.

&nbsp;

Were you really dead?

&nbsp;

Struggling that much,

isnâ€™t that just life?

&nbsp;

What is breaking free?

not while ripping peace,

jumping and storming,

tesla coil as synth.

&nbsp;

Even get to calm

within lots of noise.

&nbsp;

Mushroom kind of said,

fricking let it be,

from his dream he said,

Mary comes to me.

&nbsp;

Every war becomes

super freaky silent.
