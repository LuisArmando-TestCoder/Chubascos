This is the time

of your life

to step out of the line;

a veil that we decide

to rip from the inside out.

&nbsp;

We jump from a window,

the womb of our mothers;

mama and our darkness,

this is our goodbye.

&nbsp;

Holy enlightenment that faces the night,

I'm the sun that comes up

when pop out from the sidewalk;

I'm the chills, I'm the light,

in a storm when I'm lightning,

in the holes through the clouds,

I'm the sunray,

laser down.

&nbsp;

I'm the highway,

holy cow,

speeding brain cells

shouting loud.

&nbsp;

I think I got it,

this is how,

I've just started it,

the Ragnarök,

and what is coming,

a brand new World;

no more stutter

or broken laws,

no spirits

adrift in love.

&nbsp;

I got shelter,

my body is whole,

this is Omniverse,

playground to explore.

&nbsp;

So just keep looking

what my feet adore;

I feel Pandora´s

sense of hope,

and I know better,

I now know more,

in uncertainty

I can move on.

&nbsp;

I will raise,

I'll step up, 

as I believe

Heaven's above.

&nbsp;

My fingers stretched

grab my awe,

I'll be free

and true for long,

I'll immerse myself

in the abyssal zone.
