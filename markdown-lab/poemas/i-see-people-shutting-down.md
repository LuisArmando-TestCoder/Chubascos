I see people shutting down,

I see nonsense lighting out.

&nbsp;

I see soldiers, rows of hearts,

I see armies losing lives,

I see craters full of worms,

I see forests lust for blood,

I see nature fighting back,

I see violent bursting lies,

I see nuclear bombs arise,

I see screaming hordes that die;

blinded sense of what is right.

&nbsp;

If everybody is dead then,

then tell me who is right?

&nbsp;

Money doesn't smile back

to those who can't survive.

&nbsp;

Call each other demons,

created hell in nature,

created gods with lack of wisdom,

bretayed their laws with insurrection.

&nbsp;

Attributed the light to God,

called the black color as wrong,

sinned for ages, they killed love.

lies made them build rotten gods

who forgives them eventhough,

haven't fixed the hurt they've done.

&nbsp;

Blame it on each other,

for everybody is wrong,

everybody is mirror,

reflection to disown.

&nbsp;

I see people shutting down,

I see nonsense lighting out.

&nbsp;

I see soldiers, rows of hearts,

I see armies losing lives,

I see craters full of worms,

I see forests, lust for blood,

I see nature fighting back,

I see violent bursting lies,

I see nuclear bombs arise,

I see screaming hordes that die;

blinded sense of what is right.

&nbsp;

I see them rows of souls

waving to ground,

I see them rows of souls

waving to ground

as they´re playing out

casualties of crowns.

&nbsp;

If everybody is dead then,

then tell me who is right?

&nbsp;

Money doesn't smile back

to those who can't survive.

&nbsp;

Money doesn't smile back

when nobody is alive.

&nbsp;

I see them rows of souls

waving to ground

as they´re playing out

casualties of crowns.
