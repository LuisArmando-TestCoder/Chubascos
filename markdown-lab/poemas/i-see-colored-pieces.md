I see colored pieces,

a pretty stained glass.

&nbsp;

Pretty disastrous jar,

you keep my hope

within your curses.

&nbsp;

Madness makes art,

the prettier it gets,

the harder the urges.

&nbsp;

Broken colored pieces

of a stained glass.

&nbsp;

When you take care

of the broken madness

living stained glassy pieces;

see nothing but tons of reasons

keeping on the pulse.
