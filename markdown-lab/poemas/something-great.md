Something great, 

working until late, 

not blinking 

for a dream.

&nbsp;

Desiring the pulsing fire 

I used to be.

&nbsp;

I am a turbo sleeping,

getting up from slips.

&nbsp;

Missing igniting,

to do it all over again.

&nbsp;

Eternities waking

to the end of times.

&nbsp;

Stepping out of the line

to the axis of a life.

&nbsp;

Deterministic frames at sight,

wanna play with memories.

&nbsp;

Wanna run all the time

'till my heart explodes,

'till focus mode.

&nbsp;

Wanna smile looking backwards,

do it all for long.

&nbsp;

Wanna wake up sand

being a phoenix and ignite

the strongest golem

with no slaving signs.

&nbsp;

Wanna shine so hard,

feel my organs burning.

&nbsp;

Wanna run this time

and keep believing:

I'm all this light;

besides I am dying.

&nbsp;

Wanna take the minutes

and make them linger.

&nbsp;

To the core of self,

find myself in crossings.

&nbsp;

Wanna make me mine

untill no breathing.

&nbsp;

Wanna die in smiles,

like burning beings.
