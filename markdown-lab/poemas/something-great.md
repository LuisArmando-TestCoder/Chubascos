Something great, 

working until late, 

not blinking 

for a dream.

&nbsp;

Missing the pulsing fire 

I used to be.

&nbsp;

I am a turbo sleeping,

getting up from falls.

&nbsp;

I miss igniting,

doing it for long.

&nbsp;

Finites walking

the journey I love.

&nbsp;

Stepping out of line

to the axis of a life.

&nbsp;

Deterministic frames of movies,

in my joy at sight.

&nbsp;

Wanna run all the time

in hyper focus mode.

&nbsp;

Wanna smile looking backwards,

do it all for long.

&nbsp;

Wanna wake up ashes,

a phoenix and ignite

the strongest golem

with no slaving signs.

&nbsp;

Wanna shine so hard,

feel my organs burning.

&nbsp;

Wanna run this time

and keep believing:

I'm all this light.

&nbsp;

Wanna make time linger

before I die.

&nbsp;

To the core, ad astra,

wanna make me mine.

&nbsp;

Like light up beings,

wanna die in smiles.

&nbsp;

Wish me happy living

to the end of times.

&nbsp;

Motherboard collapsing,

I tricked my cells,

to keep pulsing tickings,

if there is no intent.

&nbsp;

I won't walk paths now

but the ones I made.

&nbsp;

I want all the gifters

in every type of lane.

&nbsp;

Loose the self in motion,

go beyond sea waves.

&nbsp;

Make myself completely

taking pride all day.

&nbsp;

This is my laugther,

life for some is gray.

&nbsp;

No need for looking

what I always take,

the chance igniting

is the time to wake,

is the time to stand up,

is the time to walk

to wherever it felt like,

now that is the north.
