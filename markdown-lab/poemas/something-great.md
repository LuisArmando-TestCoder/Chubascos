Something great, 

working until late, 

not blinking 

for a dream.

&nbsp;

My desire is

the pulsing fire 

I used to be.

&nbsp;

I am a turbo sleeping,

getting up from a slip.

&nbsp;

I want to ignite

and do it all again.

&nbsp;

Igniting to the end of times.

&nbsp;

Waking up from eternities.

&nbsp;

Stepping out of the infinite line.

&nbsp;

More than the axis of a life,

than deterministic frames at sight.

&nbsp;

Wanna play with memories

in full focus mode.

&nbsp;

Wanna run all the time

â€˜till my heart explodes.

&nbsp;

Wanna smile looking backwards,

do it all for long.

&nbsp;

Wanna wake up sand.

&nbsp;

Being a phoenix and ignite.

&nbsp;

The strongest golem

with no slaving signs.

&nbsp;

Wanna shine so hard,

feel my organs burning.

&nbsp;

Wanna run tonight

and keep believing:

I am all this light;

besides I am dying.

&nbsp;

Want to take the time,

and make it linger.

&nbsp;

Bore to the core of Earth,

find myself beyond

and cross myself.

&nbsp;

Wanna make me mine,

untill no breathing.

&nbsp;

Wanna die in smiles,

like a burning being.
