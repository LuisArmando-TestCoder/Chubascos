Something great, 

working until late, 

not blinking 

for a dream.

&nbsp;

Missing the pulsing fire 

I used to be.

&nbsp;

I am a turbo sleeping,

getting up from falls.

&nbsp;

I miss igniting,

doing it for long.

&nbsp;

Finites walking

the journey I love.

&nbsp;

Stepping out of line

to the axis of a life.

&nbsp;

Deterministic frames of movies,

in my joy at sight.

&nbsp;

Wanna run all the time

in hyper focus mode.

&nbsp;

Wanna smile looking backwards,

do it all for long.

&nbsp;

Wanna wake up ashes,

a phoenix and ignite

the strongest golem

with no slaving signs.

&nbsp;

Wanna shine so hard,

feel my organs burning.

&nbsp;

Wanna run this time

and keep believing:

I'm all this light.

&nbsp;

Wanna make time linger

before I die.

&nbsp;

To the core, ad astra,

wanna make me mine.

&nbsp;

Like light up beings,

wanna die in smiles,

wish me happy living,

'till motherboard collapse.
