Something great

might come 

between blinks.

&nbsp;

I miss the pulsing fire 

I used to be.

&nbsp;

A turbo sleeping,

getting up from slips.

&nbsp;

I miss igniting.

&nbsp;

Finites walking

the journey I love.

&nbsp;

Stepping out of line

to the axis of a life.

&nbsp;

Deterministic frames of movies,

watching live my joy at sight.

&nbsp;

Wanna run all times

in hyper focus mode.

&nbsp;

Wanna smile, 

look backwards,

do it all for long.

&nbsp;

Wanna wake up ashes,

phoenix beams of dawn.

&nbsp;

Being the strongest golem

with no slaving signs.

&nbsp;

Feel my organs burning,

I am all this light.

&nbsp;

Wanna make time linger

before finally I die.

&nbsp;

To the core, ad astra,

wanna make me mine.

&nbsp;

Like crowded light up fairies,

wanna die in smiles.

&nbsp;

Wish me happy living

to my end of times.

&nbsp;

I tricked my synapses

to keep pulsing shocks.

&nbsp;

Won't walk more paths now

than my made up norths.

&nbsp;

All gifts are waiting

in every destined lane.

&nbsp;

Loose myself in motion,

way beyond sea waves.

&nbsp;

My real laugther shows

as life for some is gray.

&nbsp;

No need for searching,

the chance igniting displays.

&nbsp;

The time to wake up has come,

is the time to stand up

in where it felt most important.

&nbsp;

It is time for hiking

towards a newer dream.
