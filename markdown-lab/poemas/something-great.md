Something great;

don't go blinking;

I tend to work till late.

&nbsp;

But I miss the pulsing fire 

I used to be.

&nbsp;

I'm a turbo sleeping,

getting up from slips.

&nbsp;

I miss igniting,

doing it for long.

&nbsp;

Finites walking

the journey I love.

&nbsp;

Stepping out of line

to the axis of a life.

&nbsp;

Deterministic frames of movies,

watching live my joy at sight.

&nbsp;

Wanna run all times

in hyper focus mode.

&nbsp;

Wanna smile, 

look backwards,

do it all for long.

&nbsp;

Wanna wake up ashes,

phoenix beams of dawn.

&nbsp;

Being the strongest golem

with no slaving signs.

&nbsp;

Feel my organs burning;

wanna run this time,

so I keep believing

I am all this light.

&nbsp;

Wanna make time linger

before finally I die.

&nbsp;

To the core, ad astra,

wanna make me mine.

&nbsp;

Like crowded light up fairies,

wanna die in smiles.

&nbsp;

Wish me happy living

to my end of times.

&nbsp;

I tricked my synapsis

to keep pulsing shocks.

&nbsp;

I won't walk other paths now

once I made up my north.

&nbsp;

All the gifts waiting

in every type of lane.

&nbsp;

Loose the self in motion,

go beyond sea waves.

&nbsp;

Make myself completely

taking pride all day.

&nbsp;

This is all my laugther;

life for some is gray.

&nbsp;

No need for searching

what I always take,

the chance igniting.

&nbsp;

Is the time to wake,

is the time to stand up,

to where it felt like going.

&nbsp;

That is our north now;

is time for walking

towards a new dream.
