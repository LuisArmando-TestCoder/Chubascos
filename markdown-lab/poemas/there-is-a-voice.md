There is a voice

inside my head.

&nbsp;

I still want a fireplace,

sit by your side

while we gaze

at the bright delay

while holding hands,

made out of cotton and bones.

&nbsp;

My smiles are sporadic.

&nbsp;

My memories are immortal

when I am thinking about you.

&nbsp;

But why does remembering peace

feels so good and hurt so much?

&nbsp;

I still want to be worthwhile a kiss,

a silly smile, a happy cry, a choking hug,

been shared a shampoo smell,

an accidental whip of silky hair.

&nbsp;

But it is a voice inside my head,

thunderous stroking gentleness.

&nbsp;

Are you really all alone?

&nbsp;

Iâ€™m no longer as impulsive,

should I shoot a thousand shots?

I just want to be the one for you alone.

&nbsp;

In regards to love,

why should I shoot

a thousand shots?

When I would shield you

for life to come.

&nbsp;

With sueters we would dance,

slowly by the fireplace,

side to side with our swetpants.

&nbsp;

I tend to fall in love

with peaceful crazyness,

with nervous laughs,

with smoothness,

with a slow mo film

of my memories

with you in it smiling,

with the wonder:

what could have happened?

&nbsp;

But it is still a voice

that asks and wonders.

&nbsp;

What if I

step one more time

out of wonder?
