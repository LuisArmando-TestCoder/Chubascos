Within silence;

not having many new experiences;

having a normal life

with no surprises.

&nbsp;

If I am a particle in the Universe

that goes unnoticed

by most of its human peers,

I could be tagged by some people

as a "ghostly nobody".

&nbsp;

All of this monkish 

type of stuff 

doesn't bore me to death, 

it's just part 

of my daily living.
