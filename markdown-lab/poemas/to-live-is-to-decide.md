To live is to decide

which desire you go for.

&nbsp;

To live is to want and pursue,

but wanting nothing at all

leads to transcend life as is.

&nbsp;

To finally be yourself

beyond life's meaning,

flow and let go forever.

&nbsp;

Within the "All There is",

I know nothing, but I know

there it is, it is there,

and I believe, so be it.
