My voice goes quiet,

but not as much,

but just enough

to get you flattered.

&nbsp;

Please, let's play

for a little while.

&nbsp;

Do you realize

this might be

the only chance we've got

to strike a lightning?

&nbsp;

Darling,

let us merge our sight;

we could tell them

that we were kidding,

that we were playing

on this quite daring

intimate scene.

&nbsp;

Maybe, just maybe,

such casual encounter

could be called

bliss.

&nbsp;

Those eyelids,

that chin,

this silk of yours

that I feel,

that holy

soft grin,

and this sinner

ductile; subtle; hazy

kiss.
