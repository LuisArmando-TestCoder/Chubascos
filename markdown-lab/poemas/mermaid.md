Mermaid, extending her hand;

I fell to the river,

deep in her smile

I am drowning in her soft grin.

&nbsp;

Irises reflecting the night

of a muse with skin of glitter,

and the breeze steaming,

whirling around,

even the air,

ghostly as I,

wants to be stroked

by her holy fingers.

&nbsp;

Mysterious when 

covered by clouds;

warm dawn, flames;

welcoming arms;

glorious gloom

of sunsets and shadows.

&nbsp;

Remind me of hope, fairy;

attraction that glows;

the only flavor left to taste

for life to be complete.
