Chaos comes from creators,

Chaos is the home of true leaders,

Chaos is the language of nature.

&nbsp;

I want to let people unravel,

And put away everything that belittles.

&nbsp;

Fear is the enemy of true chaos,

As chaos is freedom,

The one that God looks at as a kiddo;

We say that humans are imperfect,

I say that humans are shape shifters.

&nbsp;

Letting each other be

Is to promote evolution,

Even if we evolve

From bittersweet chaos,

Just like the steps of children,

Through a path of missteps, called learning;

We open the gates of Heaven

Through a chaotic path,

Larger than any abyss,

An abyss as vast as the sky,

And the sky is the limit.
