Most people want to feel loved

in a fantastic manner,

some others let the fantasy go,

to replace it with bare decency

and kindheartedness.

&nbsp;

Most times it is a buzzword,

that most likely,

most people

will never never get to experience.

&nbsp;

That is why there is so much fiction about it

filled with hope and speculation.

Writers are also human,

nescient light seekers.

&nbsp;

So here I go,

this is my take.

&nbsp;

Nobody settles for love.

Settling is for non-lovers.

Settle up or down,

it is all the same,

what a surprise!

The world is full of fakes.

&nbsp;

What is love then?

I only have this testimony.

I am sorry not sorry.

This is what you get.

&nbsp;

When you do not want it,

but you do care;

when you can live without it,

but life is not the same;

and you still come back,

and that warm holiness

does not fade.

&nbsp;

Where there is no desire, nor suffering;

real love is enlightenment.

&nbsp;

You want nothing from it,

nor suffer from it,

you are just there, wide awake,

humbled, egoless and kindhearted.

&nbsp;

Love is its own reason

to do your best.

&nbsp;

Love does not feel good,

it feels true.

&nbsp;

Where there is uselessness,

and care, regardless.
