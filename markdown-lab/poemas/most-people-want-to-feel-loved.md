Most people want to feel loved

within a Disney love fantasy,

but most times it is a buzzword,

that most likely, most people

will never know in practice.

That is why there is so much fiction

filled with hope and speculation.

&nbsp;

So here I go,

this is my take.

&nbsp;

Nobody settles for love.

Settling is for non-lovers.

Settle up or down,

it is all the same,

what a surprise!

The world is full of fakes.

&nbsp;

What is love then?

I only have a general testimony,

I am sorry not sorry,

that is what you get.

&nbsp;

When you do not want it,

but you do care,

when you can live without it, unfazed,

but you still come back every time

and that warm holiness does not fade.

&nbsp;

Where there is no desire, nor suffering;

real love is enlightenment.

You want nothing from it,

nor suffer from it,

you are just there,

humbled, egoless.

&nbsp;

Love is its own reason

to do your best.

Love does not feel good,

it feels true.

&nbsp;

Where there is uselessness

and care regardless.
