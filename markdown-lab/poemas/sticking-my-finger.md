Sticking my finger

back in my soul.

&nbsp;

Still breathing chill.

&nbsp;

Nice memories,

pain killer pills.

&nbsp;

I cared of my acts,

feeling disrupted.

&nbsp;

Nobody saves them,

you save yourself.

&nbsp;

Nobody saves them,

you save your gaze.

&nbsp;

I feel like I'm breathing.

&nbsp;

Lonely and lovely.

&nbsp;

Undress my shine.

&nbsp;

For a millionth time

I try to be the one.

&nbsp;

Legendary abyss,

Challenger Deep.

&nbsp;

I'm coming out alive.

&nbsp;

I came out surprising.

&nbsp;

I turned out an angel.

&nbsp;

I challenge my ravs.

&nbsp;

Leaving my house

feeling stronger.

&nbsp;

Nobody bother told me

which one was goodness.

&nbsp;

So I'm living the style,

I barely am guessing,

would make me proud.
