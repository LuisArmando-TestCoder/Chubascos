I like giants,

I mean,

down to earth people

who touch the sky.

&nbsp;

But irony, muse for comedy;

they are quite notorious,

not because of how tall they are

but because of how rare

it turns out to see at least one

standing out from any crowd.

&nbsp;

Most kids are born

the size of planets,

or castles, or mountains,

or rivers, or countries,

but the more they grow to our eyes,

the more they tend

to shrink in size,

and become a room,

a topic, an office,

a smartphone,

a biased perspective,

a single reason

to stay alive.

&nbsp;

Giants disguised as landscapes

growing flowers and ecosystems

on top of all that dirt

they were reciving,

so they keep themselves

as steady hills

while letting birds build nests

around their head and back and neck,

that way everybody will be safe

but just one body will be buried.

&nbsp;

But, is not an insect

gigantic to somebody else?

And they go around crawling

despite of what they might alter.

&nbsp;

Being a giant implies

destroying the status quo

with each and every step.

So, why can not giants

do just that?

&nbsp;

Walk, cruel Pachamama,

not consedering

what you leave behind,

because giants

are part of Everything,

just like Everything

makes them a part of you.
