I like giants,

I mean,

down to earth people

who touch the sky.

&nbsp;

But irony, muse for comedy;

they are quite notorious,

not because of how tall they are

but because of how rare

it turns out to see at least one

standing out from any crowd.

&nbsp;

Most kids are born

the size of planets,

but the more they grow to our eyes,

the more they tend

to shrink in size,

if their soul wasn't nurtured.
