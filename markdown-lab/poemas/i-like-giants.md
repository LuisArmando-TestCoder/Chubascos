I like giants,

I mean,

down to earth people

who touch the sky.

&nbsp;

But irony, muse for comedy;

they are quite notorious,

not because of how tall they are

but because of how rare

it turns out to see at least one

standing out from any crowd.

&nbsp;

Most kids are born

the size of planets,

or castles, or mountains,

or rivers, or countries,

but the more they grow to our eyes,

the more they tend

to shrink in size,

and become a room,

a topic, an office,

a smartphone,

a single reason

to stay alive.

&nbsp;

Giants disguised as landscapes

growing flowers and ecosystems

on top of all the dirt

they were reciving,

so they keep themselves

as steady hills.

&nbsp;

Being a giant implies

destroying the status quo

with each and every step,

so why not being part of it

while letting birds build nests

around your head and back and neck,

that way they will be safe

and you will be buried.

&nbsp;

But is not an insect

gigantic to somebody else?

they go around crawling

despite of what they might alter.

&nbsp;

So why can not giants

do just that?

&nbsp;

Walk cruel Pachamama

not consedering

what you leave behind.
