I like giants,

I mean,

down to earth people

who touch the sky.

&nbsp;

But irony, muse for comedy;

they are quite notorious,

not because of how tall they are

but because of how rare

it turns out to see at least one

standing out from any crowd.

&nbsp;

Giants disguised as landscapes

growing flowers and ecosystems

on top of all the dirt

they were reciving,

so they keep themselves

as steady hills.

&nbsp;

Most kids are born

the size of planets,

or castles, or mountains,

or rivers, or countries,

but the more they grow to our eyes,

the more they tend

to shrink in size,

and become a room,

a topic, an office,

a smartphone,

a single reason

to stay alive.
