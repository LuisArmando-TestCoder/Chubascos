I like giants,

I mean,

down to earth people

who touch the sky.

&nbsp;

But irony is funny

because they are quite notorious,

not because of how tall they are

but because of how rare

they turn out.

&nbsp;

Most kids are born

the size of planets,

or castles, or mountains,

or rivers, or countries,

but the more they grow to our eyes,

the more they tend

to shrink in size,

and become a room,

a topic, an office,

a smartphone,

a single reason

to stay alive.
