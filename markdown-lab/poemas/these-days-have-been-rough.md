These days have been rough;

I see ambulances rushing

for we are so sad and cold,

that in cold we burn;

that's our new disease, my brothers;

hopeless letters stained with salt.

&nbsp;

I see avalanches pushing

painfully awake men,

lucid dreamers

in a nightmares world,

where so few are really lucid,

have you met someone at all?

&nbsp;

All the romantic men are gone,

cuz we truly felt too clowned.

&nbsp;

Way too tragic is this heaven,

cuz we won't belong at all,

in which everybody is nothing 

but a mean to gluttony.

&nbsp;

Life was gamified and cruel,

we don't want to play no more,

we just feel like screaming

out of this lack of love.
