These days have been rough;

I see ambulances rushing

for we are so sad and cold,

that in cold is where we're burning;

that's our new disease, my brothers;

hopeless letters stained with salt.

&nbsp;

I see avalanches pushing

painfully awake men

where so few are really lucid,

have you met someone at all?

&nbsp;

All romantic men are gone,

cuz we truly felt too clowned.

&nbsp;

Way too tragic is this heaven,

cuz we won't belong at all,

in which everybody is nothing

but a mean to gluttony.

&nbsp;

Life was gamified and cruel,

we don't want to play no more,

we just feel like screaming

out of this lack of trust.

&nbsp;

Suicidal men,

suicide attempts

for just feeling well,

feeling they forget.

&nbsp;

What is controversial

in the industrial hell,

goodness is taboo;

holy shot in the head.

&nbsp;

Nobody knows if this hell

will get us to an end;

suicidal men are taking leaps

to end the pain.

&nbsp;

God doesn't care;

I asked for help;

I’m still trapped in medication;

everybody deep inside

wants me to just fucking smile

to just shut the fuck up,

to fake that I'm well,

cuz they are terrorized

by the unknown colors

that they feel won't understand,

makes them feel

how small they are,

not the center of no Universe.

&nbsp;

A speck that's numb,

nobody cares at all if you go or not,

but will you care for others?

So there are others like you,

real in the Void,

its citadel, welcome to Zion,

are you really there as well?
