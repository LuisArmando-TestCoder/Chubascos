These days have been rough;

I see ambulances rushing

for we are so sad and cold,

that in cold is where we're burning;

that's our new disease, my brothers;

hopeless letters stained with salt.

&nbsp;

I see avalanches pushing

painfully awake men

where so few are really lucid,

have you met someone at all?

&nbsp;

All romantic men are gone,

cuz we truly felt too clowned.

&nbsp;

Way too tragic is this heaven,

cuz we won't belong at all,

in which everybody is nothing

but a mean to gluttony.

&nbsp;

Life was gamified and cruel,

we don't want to play no more,

we just feel like screaming

out of this lack of trust.

&nbsp;

Suicidal men,

suicidal leaps,

suicide attempts

for feeling well,

feeling they forget

for what is controversial

in this industrial hell,

goodness is wrong,

being good is a shot in the head,

nobody knows if this hell

will get to an end,

suicidal men taking are a leap

to end the pain,

God doesn't care,

I asked for help

but I’m still trapped in medication

that makes me numb,

everybody deep inside

just wants me to fucking smile

to shut the fuck up,

to fake I'm well,

cuz they are terrorized

of finding out,

how small they truly are,

that they are not

the center of this Universe,

a speck that's numb,

nobody cares at all if you go,

but will you care for others?

So there are others like you there,

real within all extent,

in the Void, its citadel,

welcome to Zion,

are you really there as well?
