These days have been rough;

I see ambulances rushing

for we are so sad;

that's our new disease,

ink stained of salt.

&nbsp;

I see avalanches pushing

painfully awake

suicidal men

within a dreamers world,

where so few are really lucid.

&nbsp;

All the romantic men

are truly giving up.

&nbsp;

So tragic is this heaven,

in which we will not belong,

in which everybody

is nothing but a mean to an end.

&nbsp;

Life was gamified and cruel,

we don't want to play no more,

we just feel like screaming

out of this lack of love.
