I can see like how a butterfly

mates with pretty colors 

and kind of pretty lies.

&nbsp;

I can see a time waster wasted butterfly, 

ignoring realities as reality passes by.

&nbsp;

Seated on a chair waiting to die, 

consuming some content 

as content provides.

&nbsp;

I can see 

a dirty innocent butterfly, 

consumed by its nature,

hallucinations are wild.

&nbsp;

Maintain all of your focus 

over all of your pride.

&nbsp;

If you change yourself, 

change was part of your life.

&nbsp;

Keep your free will.

&nbsp;

Would we win real life?

&nbsp;

Surely better than to play 

our made up coping games.
