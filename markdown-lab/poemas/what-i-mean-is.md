What I mean is, 

I like you a lot,

I might sometimes 

be deceiving and dumb.

 

Between you and that pretty song,

I like better the thought 

of you and I

talking along to it,

but I want to know better

how to spark bravery within me.

 

That song that you caused me to sing

is the one that I like better,

but it's only because you are there,

for me to receive it.

 

What I mean is,

I like you, really;

what an alien feeling,

and that's the whole of it.

 

I hope you keep this secret,

the fact that this "you"

refers to you really.
