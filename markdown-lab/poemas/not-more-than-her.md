Not more than her. I've been called cute once, twice, thrice or maybe even more, but I don’t believe that I'm worth more than what the mirror can keep on telling me: not more than her.

&nbsp;

I desire compliments didn’t hurt as a third degree burn every time they tell them to me.

&nbsp;

There are people in this world who’s faces light up when they see you, even the sun lights up in jealousy, when you outshine it, even the sun gives up and loves it, your flare.

&nbsp;

We, down here, on planets, burn alive in flames while this sun in my head falls in love with your cold cold heart, all over again; how couldn’t anybody? one would be deaf, blind and deprived from any other senses to not fall for what you cause to them, complete and utter annihilation of pain and hopelessness; they forget in your presence that that even makes any type of sense.

&nbsp;

Sometimes I think I’m eight minutes away from you, but some others, is more like tens of millions of kilometers apart from spending a life together with you. 

&nbsp;

I think that the only thing I can really do is to burn alive within this cold cold void, like your indifference, as I imagine, I’m away from billions of stars that can’t keep up with the blinding lights coming out of your irises.

&nbsp;

I now know for a fact that if we were two stars approaching each other, we would make a fine great supernova, but not without first dancing on the waves of space/time, before we come up to the explode in it.

&nbsp;

I feel this everyday, every second of my existence. Nevermind.

&nbsp;

I adore science, the Universe, art, experiences and creativity, I adore wonders, but none of them more than her, that’s what I meant; not more than her; and also that… I adore you from miles afar.
