It is a very human feeling,

not feeling like a human.

&nbsp;

It is kind of nice.

&nbsp;

Once you get

accostumed to the abyss,

feeling like a monster

gets you some class.

&nbsp;

Black is always

the most elegant tone,

nobody sane

would say otherwise,

but an insane folk

could say it is the rainbow,

because when you squeeze it

it becomes white.

&nbsp;

Insanity lies in a spectrum

towards the noir.

&nbsp;

It is a very common feeling

not to feel part of the world,

you are surrounded by peers

in your lonely clustered town.
