Now I mourn for a chance, washed away,

it may be that I don't fit her archetype,

tired of trying to be what she expects from life,

all I see is ragdolls of sacrificial lambs,

so many versions inside of me.

&nbsp;

I remember voices begging me to watch out

for somebody that is no longer here,

but I ran for the “code of the assassin”,

no feelings, when I went to kill my spark for her,

but now I know, fire is better than coolness,

I'm mourning for those flames inside of me.
