I cried on your hatching,

slightly smiled for years

during your metamorphosis.

&nbsp;

The little place

in which

I have given you an instant

of my remaining grace,

the one shattered remainder

of my plasmatic presence,

that gave me this moment;

a little part of my everything,

before my departure.

&nbsp;

To you, this was oblivious,

a common blessing,

as of blessings

you are dressed,

cozy and sheltered.

&nbsp;

I know this will be

one one your last

sacred memories,

when you get to look

your life in reverse.

&nbsp;

I'm grateful

for this tiny space

in which I was able

to embrace your essence.

&nbsp;

Within all this noisy silence,

so many people,

so many strangers,

I once helped you fill

your not that lasting

loneliness.
