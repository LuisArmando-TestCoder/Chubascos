I love consciousness;

I love being sentient;

I love waking up from dreaming

into embracing oneâ€™s feelings;

I love my skin that burns

while grasping that tender touch,

the goosebumps,

and my ears that begin hearing;

I love being alive

when it means being present,

because one closes its eyes

when life is not worth sensing.
