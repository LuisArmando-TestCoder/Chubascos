I'm forgetting how to breath;

I'm forgetting how to walk.

 

There is just a tiny window

and timing couldn't be way worse,

and context, it is all wrong,

all your friends are like a wall.

 

I would like just being a thieve,

to rob you from all claws,

and tell you, secretly,

that your grace, I adore so much.
