Don't you know I'm Godlike, I fell three times in a row now, my knees are tampered by the sole pain of a cross, the weight is putting so much pressure as it grows.

&nbsp;

My back hurts, nobody can release it with no love.

&nbsp;

Everybody is lost; every voice inside my head that fucked me up.

&nbsp;

I'm running for a world, in which I'm not a ghost.

&nbsp;

I can see the light, but the light is from a truck.

&nbsp;

It runs me over, but my separated parts still think of love.

&nbsp;

Nobody believes, in a nobody that hasnÂ´t shown what it's made of.

&nbsp;

Nobody knows, what a nameless character is capable of.

&nbsp;

Everyone think that heroes are the ones who achieve love.

&nbsp;

Living is gross, when I didn't ask for it, and I can't say no.

&nbsp;

Depressed about love, the movies all they told me was for hyping me up.

&nbsp;

I gave them so much, talking just for money, while feeling alone. 

&nbsp;

They fed me up on reading that my faith was not enough, but nobody told me it was because I was an ugly broken broke bitch, that nobody could love, believe me I tried to do my best but, I wasn't a neurotypical in a spectrum that somebody will love, I was weird without the cute quote on quote, that nobody would love.
