Many

try on the prototype.

&nbsp;

The dream,

many pursue

what others seed,

but there was no mold

in the beginning.

&nbsp;

"What are you doing there?!",

they said screaming.

&nbsp;

"Are you crazy,

or possessed by demons?!".

&nbsp;

I can see through invisibility,

not with my eyes

but with my instinct.

&nbsp;

"What are you doing there?!".

&nbsp;

I draw graphs,

magic leans toward my index,

I am learning from patterns,

that is what I am doing.

&nbsp;

"I will tell everybody

you are a dumb fuck, weirdow!".

&nbsp;

If only you had

one additional eye,

you would understand,

once you take the mold

you melt it,

you twist it,

you make it your own.

&nbsp;

There is no prototype,

just legends

of a rising dumb fuck.
