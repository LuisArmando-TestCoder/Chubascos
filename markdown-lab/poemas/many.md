Many

try on the prototype.

&nbsp;

The dream,

many pursue

what others seed,

but there was no mold

in the beginning.

&nbsp;

"What are you doing there?!",

they said screaming.

&nbsp;

"Are you crazy,

are you possessed?!".

&nbsp;

I can see through invisibility,

not with my eyes

but with my instinct.

&nbsp;

"What are you doing there?!".

&nbsp;

I am drawing graphs,

magic from my index,

learning from patterns,

magic is leaning.

&nbsp;

"I will tell everybody

you are a dumb fuck!".

&nbsp;

If only you had

one additional eye,

you would understand

that once

you take the mold

you melt it,

you twist it,

you make it your own.

&nbsp;

There is no prototype,

just legends

of a rising dumb fuck.

&nbsp;

We walk, paths lean on.
