In the name of flames,

I'm one with my focus;

my eyes; the lighthouse.

&nbsp;

My synapses are lightning,

traveling from the core of my solar plexus,

through the branches of my body.

I'm delighted, enlightened

when I don't need to be myself,

but this moment.

&nbsp;

I feel the waves;

I'm flowing,

the tides are tsunamis,

so high that on the tip of them,

I'm weightless

in the sense of ecstasy.

Samadhi.

&nbsp;

I'm an argonaut

of the cosmos.
