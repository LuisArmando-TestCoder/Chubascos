I crumble, I run,

I tremble, my rifts,

my gut, my jungle,

the voices, the shadows,

the memories

cutting all of a sudden

the veil of my silence

with a howl.

&nbsp;

What would have happened?

What a futile experience,

what for but feeling

like submitting on a knee,

on a thought, on a bed,

under sheets, under dullness,

under uncanniness.

&nbsp;

Too much for anger,

too much for quitting,

too much for breathing,

just enough, just enough,

just enough for a tear.
