Standing; I'm drowning again,

testing my faith in the sink,

I choose to live,

my middle name; Insanity.

&nbsp;

I'm looking for freedom;

my dreamer's eyes,

driving me wild,

as I'm still standing.

&nbsp;

After three falls,

after somebody has broken my jaw

after two decades of being alone,

after a death made me so numb,

I'm standing, I'm standing,

I'm standing, I'm standing.
