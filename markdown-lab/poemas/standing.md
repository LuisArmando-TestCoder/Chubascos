Standing, I'm drowning again, 

testing my faith in the sink, 

I choose to live,

my middle name; insanity.

&nbsp;

I'm looking for freedom, 

my vindication.

&nbsp;

My dreamer's eyes;

driving me wild.

&nbsp;

Standing, I am standing, 

after three falls, 

after somebody has broken my jaw, 

after two decades of being alone, 

after a death turn me into numb,

I'm standing, I'm standing,

I'm standing, I'm standing.
