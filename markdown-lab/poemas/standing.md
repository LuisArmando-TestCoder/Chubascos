Standing; I'm drowning again, 

testing my faith in the sink, 

I choose to live,

my middle name; Insanity.

&nbsp;

I'm looking for freedom;

my dreamer's eyes,

driving me wild,

as I can see my courage inside.

&nbsp;

Still standing, I am standing, 

after three falls, 

after somebody has broken my jaw, 

after two decades of being alone, 

after a death made me so numb,

I'm standing, I'm standing,

I'm standing, I'm standing.
