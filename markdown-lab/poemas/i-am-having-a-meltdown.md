I am having a meltdown,

because I know nothing,

I am sure of anything

but my foolness.

&nbsp;

In smoking clouds I wonder,

choking in condensed fog,

losing the track of now.

&nbsp;

In plenitude of voidness

I am getting crushed

much stronger than

under nine thousand

pounds of atmospheres.

&nbsp;

I am feeling no desires

but impulses of showing

that I am really here, sentient.

&nbsp;

I am non existent,

I am part of nature

just like wind in windmills.

&nbsp;

I am eyes, I am ears,

I am taste, I am senses.

&nbsp;

God is not out there,

God is here and everywhere,

betting for life in randomness

to feel what is like to live

in another skin.

&nbsp;

I think I am opening,

this is what melting feels like,

I am blending into thy,

waking up in another height.
