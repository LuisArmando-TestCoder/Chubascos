I want you to take time

For you fuck and fight,

Nevermind,

You blew my mind,

And shot my plans,

Headshot I

Rest In Peace.

&nbsp;

So Keep me warm

And Catch my breath,

And mastermind

My full on chest,

Good bye thoughts,

I’m numb to awake,

too numb to awake.

&nbsp;

Are you a demon

Or are you death?

Succubus, pathetic end,

Why Am I being dragged,

Didn’t I control my eyes,

Why do I still stare,

like I’m lost in two pupils?

&nbsp;

So Keep me warm

And Catch my breath,

And mastermind

My full on chest,

Good bye thoughts,

I’m numb to awake,

too numb to awake.
