Do not be like the butterfly, 

that mates with pretty colors 

and kind of pretty lies.

&nbsp;

Do not be a time waster wasted butterfly, 

ignoring realities as real life passes by.

&nbsp;

Seated on a chair waiting to die, 

consuming some content 

as content provides.

&nbsp;

Do not be like the blind

dirty innocent butterfly, 

consumed by its nature,

hallucinations are wild.

&nbsp;

Maintain all your focus 

over all of your pride.

&nbsp;

If you change yourself, 

change was part of your life.

&nbsp;

Smile looking forward, 

ignore flying lies.

&nbsp;

Keep your free will.

&nbsp;

Would we win real life?

&nbsp;

Surely better than to play 

all of our fake games.
