Gentle giants

disguised as landscapes

growing flowers and ecosystems

on top of their backs,

they keep themselves as steady hills

while letting birds build nests

on the roots of their head.

&nbsp;

But, is not an insect

gigantic to somebody else?

Is not an insect selfish.

&nbsp;

Being a giant implies

destroying the status quo

with every step.

&nbsp;

So walk,

like our cruel Pachamama does.
