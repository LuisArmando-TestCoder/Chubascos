I want my art

not being content

with an overstimulated

insensible audience,

that devours artworks

just because

that is the character they are playing,

the character of the audience

that spends time

in between the process

called aging;

watching,

but not observing.

&nbsp;

I want my art

to be a life changer,

or life reafirming,

enduring in their memories,

as it is important for them,

so it is kept for the ages.
