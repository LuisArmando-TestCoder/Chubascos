Accept reality, deal with shit, get what you want.

&nbsp;

To want is not bad, nor to pursue, or to push, because morality is an illusion.

&nbsp;

Being alive is an emergent behavior out of interactions coming together in ways that allow their inevitable locomotion towards ways of selfpreservation, but also, the fact that we can exist and think with time to spare that gives us the possibility to spend it in whatever crap we feel like, it doesn't matter, nothing does, that is why we can hallucinate that we choose our priorities, like having a beyond beautiful house, family, victorious adventures and moreâ€¦

&nbsp;

Because everything is possible, everything is freed, as it always has been.

&nbsp;

We are connected and always have been, and always will be, to acknowledge it is a happening, it might just feel different when you realize about it, and take the limiters away, if you care about it.
