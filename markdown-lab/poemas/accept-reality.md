Accept reality, deal with shit, get what you want, want is not bad, because morality is an illusion, being alive is an emergent behavior coiming out particles coming together in ways that allow their inevitable locomotion towards ways of selfpreservation, but also, the fact that we can exist and think with time to spare gives us the possibility to spend it in whatever crap we feel like, it doesn't matter, nothing does, that is why we can hallucinate that we choose our priorities, like having a beyond beautiful house, family, victorious adventures and more...

Because everything is possible, everything is freed, as it always has been.
