When silence finally turns on

the very creep you are inside,

all the voices sinking,

they remind you,

that loneliness you keep.

&nbsp;

They got a room,

they got their space

in a city full of stars,

you seemed like pushed to shine,

in this deep, deep, deep wide space

with no hydrogen in sight.

&nbsp;

If danger chasing

was so very tired,

Is the freedom march in sight?

&nbsp;

My outstanding races

to keep my chin at least

above all waves.

&nbsp;

Would I find peace now?

&nbsp;

Father, please, please,

tell me,

Was I fighting in eternity?

&nbsp;

Would I wonder in her arms

or would I wonder in your hands?

&nbsp;

Am I wondering just now,

down to earth,

touching the sky?

&nbsp;

Am I a giant or what is going on?

Why can I only see the clouds

now that silence has finally turned on?
