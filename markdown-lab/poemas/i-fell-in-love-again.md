I fell in love again, with the same face, and the same girl, she’s just slightly wiser every time I happen to meet her, but she’s just as pretty as the time I happen to encounter the pupils that I prayed to. She might not be the one for me, but life feels greater knowing that she’s there, just there, and I’m here, not knowing how to ignite a spark in me, if I was as beautiful as her she might slightly look at me, but I’m here, writing instead of living it.
