I am gone, but don't you know I'm God, I fell three times in a row; my knees are tampered by the sole pain of an evil cross; the weight is putting so much pressure as it grows.

&nbsp;

My back hurts, nobody can release it with no love, for everybody that is lost; for every voice inside my head that fucked me up.

&nbsp;

I'm running for a world, where I'm not a ghost.

&nbsp;

I can see the light, but light's from a truck.

&nbsp;

It runs me over, but my separated crane still think of love.

&nbsp;

Nobody believes, in a nobody that hasnÂ´t shown what that nobody is made of.

&nbsp;

Nobody knows, what a nameless character is capable of.

&nbsp;

Everyone thinks that heroes are the ones that can achieve love.

&nbsp;

Living is gross, when I didn't ask for it, when I can't say no.

&nbsp;

Depressed about love, the movies all they told me was for hyping me up. I gave them so much money, they were talking just for more, but some are feeling alone. 

&nbsp;

They fed me up on reading that faith was not enough, but nobody told me it was because I was an ugly broken broke bitch, that nobody could love, believe me I tried to do my best but, I wasn't enough.

&nbsp;

A non-neurotypical in a spectrum that they could love, I was weird from the womb. A was weird baby without the quote on quote, which nobody would love.
