I am gone, but don't you know I'm God? I fell three times in a row; my knees are tampered by the sole pain of an evil cross; the weight is putting so much pressure as it grows.

&nbsp;

My back hurts; nobody can release that without any love, for everybody is lost; for every voice inside my head that fucked me up.

&nbsp;

I'm running for a world, where I'm not a ghost. I can see the light, but light is from a truck. It runs me over, while my separated crane still thinks of love.

&nbsp;

Nobody believes in a nobody that hasnÂ´t shown what that nobody is really made of.

&nbsp;

Nobody knows what a nameless character is capable of.

&nbsp;

Living is gross, when I didn't ask for it, and when I cannot say no.

&nbsp;

Everyone thinks that heroes are the ones that are able to achieve love. Well then, farewell, call me a villain then, cause I'm the bitter one with an evil plan to circumvent through hapiness, despite foreign injustice.

&nbsp;

I'm depressed about love, the movies all they told me was for hyping me up. I gave them so much money, they were acting for more, getting richer with the fact that some of us are feeling alone. 

&nbsp;

They fed me up on reading that my faith was not enough; nobody told me it was cause I am an ugly broken broke, that nobody could love, I tried my best but it really hurts as I wasn't enough.

&nbsp;

I'm not a cute neurotypical, that you can call a toy, I'm a weirdo from the womb. Am I pretty or not? But I am not, I am just special quote on quote, which nobody would love, I'm tired of this nightmare, so at daylight I'm gone.
