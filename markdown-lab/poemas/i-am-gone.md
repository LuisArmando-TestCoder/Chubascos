I am gone, but don't you know I'm God? I fell three times in a row; my knees are tampered by the sole pain of an evil cross; the weight is putting so much pressure as it grows.

&nbsp;

My back hurts; nobody can release that without love, for everybody is lost; for every voice inside my head that fucked me up.

&nbsp;

I'm running for a world, where I'm not a ghost. I can see the light, but light is from a truck. It runs me over, while my separated crane still thinks of love.

&nbsp;

Nobody believes in a nobody that hasnÂ´t shown what that nobody is made of.

&nbsp;

Nobody knows what a nameless character is capable of.

&nbsp;

Living is gross, when I didn't ask for it, and when I cannot say no.

&nbsp;

Everyone thinks that heroes are the ones able to achieve love. Well then, farewell, call me a villain then, cause I'm the bitter one with an evil plan to circumvent injustice, and achieve my hapiness once and for all.

&nbsp;

Depressed about love, the movies all they told me was for hyping me up. I gave them so much money, so they were talking just for more, but some of us are feeling alone. 

&nbsp;

They fed me up on reading that my faith was not enough; nobody told me it was cause I am ugly broken broke bitch, that nobody could love, I tried my best but it hurts that I wasn't enough.

&nbsp;

I'm not a cute neurotypical, I'm weird from the womb. Am I pretty? I am not, I am special quote on quote, which nobody would love, I'm tired of this nightmare, at daylight I'm gone.
