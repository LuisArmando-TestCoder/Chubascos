One in love goes numb,

one can only tell how much

of an obsession it becomes,

so much that every facet

is heavenly placed upon

that character one now adores;

a remembrance becomes a drug,

a hypnotizing mirage

so false, but so right.

&nbsp;

Falling like floating

to an imminent crash;

a storm is coming;

I dream of stroking

your thighs and remain

oblivious to all callings

of backing off forever

from those dangerous wonders

within your taciturn eyes.

&nbsp;

Even if betrayed,

even when you have made up your mind,

"there is no such place

for such a liar",

might you add,

"You know what? I'll move on

and leave the past in the past",

and even with that,

a surprising glance

at each other

can break your vows in an instant,

like these were nothing,

like this creature's sight

was a hammer

and you were glass.

&nbsp;

The great divinity

just needs to ask

not even quite gently

and move one finger

and you will be

on your knees, on command.

&nbsp;

When you love,

you face a tide you cannot help

not getting sucked by;

love is not a bitch,

it is a conqueror,

and you are resigning

th kingdom of your soul.

&nbsp;

Why can't you help it?

To picture a life ahead.

So lame, if they knew it.

&nbsp;

When falling for someone,

you realize you are getting

pulled to the Sun.

&nbsp;

It is one of the loneliest experiences

to be shy while being a lover,

it is one of the deepest

and most obnoxious abysses

you might fall into,

you want to scream so badly

"I love you! I do...",

yet, you are mute;

"I would give my life for you!",

yet, silence;

"I need you! you are my everything!",

yet, no moves.

&nbsp;

This emblematic pain

evidences you are alive,

as it kills you slowly.

&nbsp;

Being away from your lover

is not painful as is,

it is painful to know

the location of heaven

while sitting outside its gates

wondering alone.
