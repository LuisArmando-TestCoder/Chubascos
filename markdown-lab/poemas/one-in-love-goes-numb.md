One in love goes numb,

one can only tell how much

of an obsession it becomes,

so much that every facet

is heavenly placed upon

that character one now adores;

a remembrance becomes a drug,

a hypnotizing mirage, still, false,

but that's allright.

&nbsp;

A storm is coming;

oblivious to all callings

of backing off forever

from those dangerous wonders,

your taciturn eyes.
