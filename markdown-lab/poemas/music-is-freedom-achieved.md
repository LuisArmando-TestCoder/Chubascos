Music is freedom achieved, that does not end.

&nbsp;

It is the closest thing to divinity, alongside real love.

&nbsp;

Music runs spasms through your body, little by little, until it totally controls your being.

&nbsp;

But, is it control? or could it be that your brain waves get so much in sync with the rhythm that it transforms you into someone else? and now you lie there, vibin in its frequency.

&nbsp;

It's fucking glorious, brother.

&nbsp;

The sounds of music can completely command your system, so much so that you lose the reign of your being and who you are, like excessive alcohol, your mind can't take it anymore and you sprawl in awry sovereignty.

&nbsp;

So be it, amen to its holy possession, my soul vows to its master.

&nbsp;

The God of music enters your ears and claims you as his, controls your body, your being, even if you wanted to escape, which you won't, it is impossible to get out of there, it is a loop, a time crystal.

&nbsp;

Endless paradox, where did you come from? imagination? As his image and likeness, this is a direct channel to its chamber, we visit our origin, we become Godlike.

&nbsp;

You know what a feeling is? No? Yes? Okay. Can you eat it? No. Can you touch it? No. But it always accompanies you. Do you know who it is? Your best friend.

&nbsp;

How pleasing, how hurting, how wild, how sacred? A shrine, a chapel, Aleluya! Even Luzbel is pulling out some headphones.

&nbsp;

We are all vibing to soul, banging to rock, dancing to funk, waving to rap.

&nbsp;

Music goes beyond science, metaphysicality.

&nbsp;

Music is holy, mantras in lyrics.
