I am happy, but I crumble,

grey looks like my new color,

seems rusty, so it is glowing

in another dimension.

&nbsp;

I am stock in

this monochrome dementia,

I want to see at least red.

&nbsp;

Am I happy? Am I a man?

Can I get rid of

this choking chains?

&nbsp;

Look at me,

I am smiling,

now let me be,

do not let me vanish.

&nbsp;

No, I will not let you

corrupt my shrine.

&nbsp;

I will rather die

or get stock in a loop

before giving you access

to my dearest

spectral belongings.
