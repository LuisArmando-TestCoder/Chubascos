I am happy, but I crumble,

grey looks like my new color.

&nbsp;

I am stock in

monochrome dementia,

in another dimension

even rustyness glows to me.

&nbsp;

Am I happy?

Am I a man now?

Can I get rid of

these choking chains already?

before my veins splatter

along with my hope.

&nbsp;

Look at me,

I am smiling,

now let me be,

do not let me vanish.

&nbsp;

No, I will not let you

corrupt my shrine.

&nbsp;

I will rather die

or get stock in a loop

before giving you access

to my dearest

spectral belongings.
