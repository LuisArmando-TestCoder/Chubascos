I feel everything;

no drugs, not kidding;

my senses; their the thoughts,

their past, their possibilities.

&nbsp;

My imagination is so wild,

I picture myself

experiencing past lifes,

and I am all of them;

their mecanisms;

every single one

that I observe.

&nbsp;

I love them,

but they don't know me;

that's ok,

I'm not just my body,

but everything else.

&nbsp;

I know what I am,

and who I am,

as if I knew it

from the beginning.

&nbsp;

I can even feel the identity

that so many others carry around,

as a toy fueled by validation,

a toy, a mask, some chains

wrapped around their arms,

all of them are an illusion,

even the lie that states

that they need a mirage to survive.

&nbsp;

I see them trapped inside,

fearful of rejection;

I see them curious ones,

free from obligations.

&nbsp;

I'm awake, but closed,

I'm immobile, just listening.

&nbsp;

I don't desire anymore,

but I keep playing

the Conway's Game of Life,

this cellular automata

full of attractions.

&nbsp;

I extend my arms up

to freedom.
