I feel everything, and I have no drugs inside, and I'm not kidding, my senses can feel the thoughts, the past, the possibilities, my imagination is so wild, I'm imagine myself experiencing their life, their mecanism, I end up loving them without them knowing who I am, I imagine I'm not just my body but everything around, I know what I am, and I am so surprised of my own happiness because of this fact, I can even feel the identity that so many other ones are trapped inside of, I'm awake and playing as if I was not, I don't have anymore desires, I'm just playing the Game of Life, within the cellular automata I'm at, I'm playing without a plan, exploring the attractions of life, which begin letting one's mind to wonder all over again at the tiny details nobody is looking at, I extend my arms at the deepest height.
