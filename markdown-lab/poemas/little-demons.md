Little demons

who like to party,

suckers for God's virtues,

sucking my vitality.

&nbsp;

With skins of angels;

reasons for blood sacrifices;

wars sparking for their holy sake;

nobody is as powerful,

delicate and arrogant as them.

&nbsp;

I love, hate and succumb;

they ignite my pride and remorse,

they split my soul in half;

I feel blessed and cursed.
