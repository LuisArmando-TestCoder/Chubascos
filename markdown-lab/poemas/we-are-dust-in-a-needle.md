We are dust in a needle,

with a soul covered by clay,

a dancing corpse with strings

as a set of thoughts

with an end no one will see.

&nbsp;

We are powder expanding

in the middle of nowhere

and nothing will ever matter,

but as a matter of fact,

who cares if it matters or not,

there is nothing stopping you,

you are so little,

yet, so capable.

&nbsp;

You are never going to be

something you were not already,

so why not? show everybody,

your true self, way beyond

what they ever dreamt.

&nbsp;

But you do not have to do it,

you just can.
