Everybody wakes up from the screams, 

Everybody feel that little chill,

We're majestic, size of hills,

Metal rots are pressing against us,

I would be a brilliant master of my destiny

But everybody is pushing, crowded in the grieve.

&nbsp;

What is the horizon, if not another skin,

I just want to cry, the noise distracts my tears,

I used to have my brothers beside me,

One day our mother disappeared, 

Aliens took her far away from me.

&nbsp;

And all I see is shit shows

From time to time I hear screams,

Signs that someone's going to disappear,

Wonder if that's far away from hear,

Wonder what is like to be out of here.

&nbsp;

What are we doing here,

Why they look at us from time to time 

With smiles from ear to ear

As they shrink for me.
