You rest in peace,

Oh, wait, you just can't;

I'm just choking

with laughter at your expense.

&nbsp;

Dust in space,

That's where you belong;

She gets to resurrect me,

For you, she's so long gone.

&nbsp;

A blue phoenix,

You wish that you could be;

Adrift in space,

With your failures and your destiny.

&nbsp;

My thirst, I swear,

Not for your tears;

Oh, your lovely pain,

You suffer and I sing.

&nbsp;

Love is so deceiving,

When it's for you;

I'm getting to the end,

Pretending I care about you.

&nbsp;

I'm looking for a place,

Where you're not there;

No endless pain,

Just blissful air.

&nbsp;

In Hilbert's Space,

Love's a torture fractal;

For you, my dear,

It's just a painful hassle.

&nbsp;

Is not a nightmare,

It's just your reality;

A horrible time crystal,

That I'll enjoy watching.

&nbsp;

But there's no end,

To my amusement at your pain;

I never swallow that blue pill,

Because you suffer

and it's too entertaining to refrain.

&nbsp;

Love for pain,

Your motto as it seems;

Nostalgia is just,

Your last desperate dream.

&nbsp;

Back again,

Laughing at your defeat;

You choking in space,

And I take a seat.

&nbsp;

She's a sun that burns me,

For you it's just a dim light;

She's still crushing my rips,

For you it's just a lost fight.

&nbsp;

I'm looking for a way,

To forget about you, Mr;

But nostalgia is nothing,

Compared to my amusement.
