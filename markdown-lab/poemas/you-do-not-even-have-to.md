You do not even have to

conquer yourself,

you have to let yourself

go in your passions,

and within each one of them,

get lost in your focus.

&nbsp;

It does not matter

if you are successful afterwards,

it only matters

that when you are doing it,

regardless of the outcome,

you will be whole.

&nbsp;

Whenever you get back

to that place,

you will be attaching yourself

to the gears of the Universe

and you will become everything

and the futile hours will transform

into precious gems

as no other treasure chest guards.

&nbsp;

This nucleus will be

your jewel in privacy

and its kaleidoscopes

under a sunray.

&nbsp;

In summary,

do not meditate to focus,

focus to meditate,

as its own nonsense

makes all sense.
