From a side of my sight

your silhouette was it,

causing me to give up

on this dream of being alone,

now I can't stop picturing

my evenings with

your skin and soul.

&nbsp;

At first glance

you made me think

it was not that bad

being who myself is,

unapologetically.

&nbsp;

For what I stand

you are an omen

of everything

being more than ok.

&nbsp;

Is my decision

to take the leap

and bring peace

to the frightening,

to the unknown,

to the dark clouds

within the storm

with rainy doubts.

&nbsp;

I point out out of many

who might have already

point out at you, darling:

I felt the wonder walking

when you were passing

across my horizon line.

&nbsp;

You are a marvel to my eyes.

&nbsp;

Regardless of us

spending time

with each other,

that is what I

thought about you.
