For us to wait,

time isn't meant.

&nbsp;

Would I comply?

&nbsp;

Time doesn't wait.

Why would I?

&nbsp;

Push the rules away

for a little while.

&nbsp;

We will be throwing out

the norms the fuck out,

my words in your mouth.

&nbsp;

Short notice

feels too long.

&nbsp;

A kiss in my brain

but I jump with a step.

&nbsp;

Oh God, your skin,

feels like a storm.

&nbsp;

We are like a sun,

inevitable warm.

&nbsp;

Are boundaries good

when I find you so close?

&nbsp;

Aren't we supposed to preach

what love is as we act?

&nbsp;

We are alone

with our touch,

let's take care

of ourselves.

&nbsp;

Let's waltz along

our mistress heart.

&nbsp;

Come here.

&nbsp;

Keep it running.
