Rest in peace,

but I'm just choking;

I'm dust in space;

she gets to resurrect me.

&nbsp;

Blue phoenix;

I'm thinking about her

adrift in space,

walking like a zombie.

&nbsp;

My thirst, I swear,

didn't stop while drowning;

oh, lovely pain,

love is so deceiving.

&nbsp;

I'm getting to the end;

I'm looking for a place

where she is not there;

no endless pain

in Hilbert's Space,

where love is not a torture fractal;

where love is not a nightmare;

a horrible time crystal.

&nbsp;

But there's no end;

I never swallow that blue pill,

cuz love for pain,

nostalgia is just

too fucking sweet.

&nbsp;

I'm back again,

choking in space;

she is a sun that burns me,

she is still crushing my rips.

&nbsp;

I'm looking for a way

to swallow this blue pill,

but seems like I just can't;

nostalgia is nothing

but just fucking sweet.

&nbsp;

Adrift in space,

I'm blue phoenix;

I still don't cry;

her flare burns nothing

but my everything.
