If you chew

your words too much,

these will vanish

in your mouth.

&nbsp;

You want to be understood,

which is having faith

in someone else's

interpretation of reality.

&nbsp;

But nobody understands,

you empathize with yourself

to circumvent

ego's veil,

what if you have ego

for each of them?

&nbsp;

What if,

you never understood nobody

outside yourself?

Aren't they a simulation within you?
