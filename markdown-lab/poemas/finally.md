Finally,

I've come to realize

at the bottom of the abyss.

Within infinite irrelevance,

lies absolute freedom.

No amount of fame and glory

is going to make you less unimportant.

&nbsp;

There is no I, no us,

just nothingness

and its paradoxical unity,

giving birth in a kiss

to a spontaneous everything.

&nbsp;

My only comfort was

that I know I am two eyes in a body;

egocentric nobody;

almost sentient;

almost living;

senses of The Everything,

and within it,

splattered,

I arise.

&nbsp;

I salute the epoch

of my heretic awareness.

&nbsp;

There is no loneliness.

There is nobody.

&nbsp;

My primeval chains

lie broken.
