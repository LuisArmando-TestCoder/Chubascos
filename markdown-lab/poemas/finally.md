Finally,

I've come to realize

at the bottom of the abyss.

Within infinite irrelevance,

lies absolute freedom.

No amount of fame and glory

is going to make you less unimportant.

&nbsp;

All there is nothingness

in its paradoxical unity,

giving birth in a looping kiss

to a spontaneous Everything.

&nbsp;

My only comfort was that,

I am making Existence sentient.

&nbsp;

Egocentric nonentity;

there is no loneliness

as there is nobody.

&nbsp;

I salute the epoch

of my heretic awareness.

&nbsp;

My primeval chains

lie broken.
