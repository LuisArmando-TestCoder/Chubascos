She seemed like a healer,

up to fix my life;

she seemed like a fairy,

floating on my hands.

&nbsp;

I was tiny and faithful

call me a reckless child,

time stopped for us;

we lived in Neverland.

&nbsp;

Didn't realize;

blessings were took

for granted

and were disguised.

&nbsp;

You,

my dearest Goddess,

dear,

God I disguised.

&nbsp;

You looked so perfect;

but I ain't worth the time;

I didn't love you

like you loved me back.

&nbsp;

I felt for the rush,

but the rush is vile,

I truly want nothing,

nor anyone.

&nbsp;

Did we spend our chance?

Love is not the same.

&nbsp;

In the aftermath

I'm having a cold from ice.
