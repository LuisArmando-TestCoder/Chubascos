God takes it easier

and goes harder than the devil.

&nbsp;

God in Earth, truly,

is unapologetic

on immersing the self

in moments.

&nbsp;

God truly dances,

truly fights and truly flows.

&nbsp;

God knows better

how to get the best

out of any situation.

&nbsp;

It is so obvious

everything he is saying,

by any means

God is escoteric.

&nbsp;

Feels younger

than the children,

and way wiser

than any other

alien beings.

&nbsp;

Chill and empathetic,

stable with a trigger,

the biggest destruction button

of any Universe.

&nbsp;

In its free will,

sees free will beings,

with godly potential,

if they feel it.
