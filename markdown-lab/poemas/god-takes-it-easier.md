God takes it easier

and goes harder than the devil.

&nbsp;

God in Earth, truly,

is unapologetic

on immersing the self

in moments.

&nbsp;

God truly dances,

truly fights

and truly flows.

&nbsp;

God knows better

how to get the best

out of any situation.

&nbsp;

It is so obvious

everything it is saying;

by any means

God is escoteric.

&nbsp;

Feels younger

than children,

and way wiser

than any other

alien being.

&nbsp;

Chill and empathetic,

stable with a trigger,

the biggest destruction button

on a living being.

&nbsp;

In its free will,

sees free will beings,

with godly potential,

if they can feel it.

&nbsp;

God looks forward,

as one gives it all

and then, keeps going.

&nbsp;

God is infinite

in everybody,

God is awakening

in one's realization,

that one, got it.

&nbsp;

When one is awake,

God is awake within.
