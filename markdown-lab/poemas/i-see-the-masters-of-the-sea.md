I see the masters of the sea,

pulling our heart strings, 

bottom of the Atlantic, 

hordes of ruins, disaster, 

I see.

&nbsp;

Looking above I look at the tides, 

it´s never enough of chasing a lie, 

bought sadness away, 

but sadness came back, 

it´s never enough,

they swallow a lie.

&nbsp;

American dream,

they ask for a loan, 

we become slaves,

rats in the maze,

running all day, 

getting nowhere, 

&nbsp;

Out of their minds

they're out of their minds, 

it's normalized 

not being surprised 

injustice strikes.

&nbsp;

Nobody notices

how empty within,

some try to kill,

or grab their heads

what happened there

they were content,

but is never enough,

what a cruel lie,

the one that we're told,

that's never enough.
