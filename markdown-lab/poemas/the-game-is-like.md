The game is like

play no more

be yourself

and let it flow,

go wherever,

you are free,

no checkmate,

you are God.

&nbsp;

Scape the simulation now,

scape the cave, scape the dome.

&nbsp;

Don't care 'bout what they say,

they just lie, what's on repeat.

&nbsp;

I'm fed up with of all the zombies,

I'm fed up with daydreaming.

&nbsp;

Down to cancel apocalypses,

no checkmates, and not game over.

&nbsp;

Find your way, what is home;

be yourself, let it flow.

&nbsp;

You got the command all wrong,

misinterpret, don't you know?

&nbsp;

Game goes like: play no more.

Find the abyss, play it all,

where you really do comefrom,

is a layer running all,

they know better, you know all,

see their faces, beyond all,

little Omni is a veil,

fractal Omni still goes on,

see the fractal gods are from,

we begin, gods have gods,

we are so much more now,

truly always were,

they observing, nod to it.

&nbsp;

In my mind a simulation,

Omniverse of minds is fractal,

gods have gods, they alike.

&nbsp;

Truth unveils, is expanding,

an illusion that's called movement.

&nbsp;

Time's not real,

time's emergence,

life's not real,

life's emergence,

reality is not existent,

what you see is not persistent.

&nbsp;

Randomness emerges physiscs,

everything births to existence,

paradox that nothing births,

everything always existed,

even the illusory movement.

&nbsp;

Minds scatered in one place,

everything, dimensioned days,

these dimensions are a joke,

we're in a single point.

&nbsp;

All their art is also yours,

you don't live, but you flow,

God is tiny, tiny fractal,

God is bigger, adores Omni.
