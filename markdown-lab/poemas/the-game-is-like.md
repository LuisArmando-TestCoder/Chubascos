The game is like

play no more,

be yourself

and let it flow.

&nbsp;

Go wherever,

you are free;

no checkmate,

you are God.

&nbsp;

Scape the simulation now;

scape the cave; scape the dome.

&nbsp;

Don't you mind what they say,

they just lie on repeat.

&nbsp;

I'm fed up with of all the zombies;

I'm fed up with daydreaming.

&nbsp;

Down to cancel apocalypses;

no checkmates and not game over.

&nbsp;

Find your way; what is home?

Be yourself and let it flow.

&nbsp;

You got the command all wrong;

misinterpret, don't you know?

&nbsp;

Game goes like: play no more.

Find the abyss, play it all;

where you really do comefrom,

is a layer running all.

&nbsp;

They know better; you know all;

see their faces, beyond all.

&nbsp;

Little omni is a veil;

fractal Omni still goes on;

see the fractal gods are from,

we begin; gods have gods

we are so much, now you know,

what we are truly made of.

&nbsp;

In my mind a simulation,

multiverse of minds is fractal,

gods have gods

and we are like that.

&nbsp;

Truth unveils, it's expanding,

an illusion that's called movement.

&nbsp;

Time's not real,

time's emergence,

life's not real,

words are nowhere,

reality is not existent,

what you see is not persistent.

&nbsp;

Randomness emerges physiscs,

everything births to existence,

paradox that nothing births in,

for everything that did exist in.

&nbsp;

Minds scattered in one place;

everything in its right place;

these dimensions are a joke,

we're a single layout point.

&nbsp;

All their art is also yours,

you don't live, but you flow,

God is tiny, tiny fractal,

Omni is bigger, God in all.
