Living a RPG,

in a MMO.

&nbsp;

I don't know where I could go

but I am sure of being lost.

&nbsp;

I am still trying

even though I'm lost.

&nbsp;

I paint a paradise

in top of hell.

&nbsp;

Existing doesn't feel that very well.

&nbsp;

Then I smile a creepy smile that swells.

&nbsp;

My eyes are drowning

with no tears to clean.

&nbsp;

Indifference is killing me.

&nbsp;

I wanted them to love me,

but I am giving up this dream.

&nbsp;

I run out of reasons,

but I'm keeping out this will.

&nbsp;

There are no factual answers

for me stepping over here.

&nbsp;

Might I want to go;

there is a wall impeding it.

&nbsp;

Cannot I get it right?

&nbsp;

Why cannot I just see?

&nbsp;

What is keeping all this fight?

Am I a NPC?

&nbsp;

Why it hurts so much

that I feel so little now?

&nbsp;

Is this an ond perverted God

the one observing beneath my soul?

&nbsp;

If I feel so little,

how could I feel this weight 

for so very long?

&nbsp;

Is my neck too bent now?

Can I walk straight again?

&nbsp;

In this black skybox,

how can I imagine yellow?

&nbsp;

My sight sees monochrome,

unlike my imagination.

&nbsp;

Are these colors dripping off my skin?

&nbsp;

Do I feel so little?

Did I felt too much?

&nbsp;

Am I experiencing a trance?

&nbsp;

I want so bad

to wake up once and for all.
