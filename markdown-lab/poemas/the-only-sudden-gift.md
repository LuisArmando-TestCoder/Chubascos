The only sudden gift

I can get from somebody

I do not know,

is a laugh or a smile,

an honest one.

&nbsp;

How could you blame us

for hating monotony?

We are explorers

trapped in a cage of concrete,

connecting makes us stronger,

but everybody is hiding

their sight from one another.

&nbsp;

I'm ripping common sense out

from the skin of my chest;

how wouldn't I,

fake smiles made me rip

my life away

out of loneliness.

&nbsp;

"Don't talk to strangers",

a good advice

that made us lose

so many timelines,

friends and enemies.

&nbsp;

Have you ask yourself,

why are some so dumb?

Why do they clown so much?

Aren't some trying to cause

what is not there as much

but we hoped was more of it?

&nbsp;

Isn't it that an ecstatic grin

could make us forget

how lonely we truly are?

We, and our woke wit.

&nbsp;

Yes, it is pathetic indeed,

because before being,

men or women,

or a box of being,

we are inflammable grains

barely moving

in a destinyless trajectory

surrounded by absurdity,

an extraordinary ordinary

ancient landscape

that we won't grasp,

unless we accept it,

and as we do,

why not chase then beauty?

A tiny good honest smile

could be better than nothing.
