I want to shine

like a shooting beam

of a pulsar star.

&nbsp;

My sweat of purple alien blood,

it does not feel like acid,

no more acid in my throat,

but bubbling lava that I pump

through my veins of tantalum.

&nbsp;

I knew from the beginning

I was a damn alien in this world.

&nbsp;

This is not just my ego

with no end in sight,

this is my egocentric nature

thriving in its natural lies.

&nbsp;

But oh lord, how would I adapt

if it seems that my shape

is way deformed for this puzzle,

that composes with its individuals

a bigger, timeless soul.

&nbsp;

So, how can I shine

ultraviolet light

to their biased eyes?
