I saw a nymph singing way too wild,

a mermaid that was extending her hand;

I fell to the river, deep in her smile;

her eyes were shining like two gems

down by the moonlight;

I am drowning in her soft grin.

&nbsp;

Irises reflecting the night

of a muse with skin of glitter,

and the breeze steaming,

whirling around her fingers,

even the air wants to be stroked;

she, like a beautiful landscape,

you can't get enough of.
