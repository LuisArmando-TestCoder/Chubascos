Many times the truth

does not lie on either side,

but within an average of averages.

&nbsp;

Many times we have to

walk away from a biased side

to see a much richer perspective.

&nbsp;

If a statement confuses you

because it seems like

it does not portrait as much

of what you expected

but as well, not too little,

it usually lies in the middle

of a spectrum that was

mistakenly contrasted.
