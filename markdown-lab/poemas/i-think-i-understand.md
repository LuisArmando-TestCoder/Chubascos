I think I understand, 

we are contrary waves,

in the delta of the sea,

nature opposite, 

direction clashing means,

perversely disagree.

&nbsp;

I don’t think the way 

you’d like me to.

&nbsp;

I understand 

but not the way

you’d like me to.

&nbsp;

You are the antithesis,

no cooperation, 

you obstruct.

&nbsp;

You are a painter,

all the way

painting biases,

our mentalities, 

inverse.

&nbsp;

I might be young

but wise enough.

&nbsp;

I don’t have to be so good,

to you is unconvenient,

conveniently you do.

&nbsp;

Forgetting all your sins,

for all the lessons 

to pass by.

 

You paint waves 

of illusions,

rationalizing hopelessness,

I might be young 

but I’m not deaf.

&nbsp;

I hear the waves clashing,

today I woke up,

I got the message,

annihilation 

of our crisis,

decimation 

of our clashing.

&nbsp;

I look you in the eye

so I ever 

don’t look back,

our contrast very far,

either way I understand,

we are just not made 

for each other.
