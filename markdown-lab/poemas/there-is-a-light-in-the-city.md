There is a light in the city,

that never dies,

invisible to daylight,

a shrine for every night.

&nbsp;

Before the dawn

some walk pass by,

and some little hope,

restored for a little while.

&nbsp;

There is a light in the city,

that never dies,

made for all the nomads,

each and every night.

&nbsp;

Before the rise of the Sun,

there is a light;

extended stain of darkness

that gets sliced.

&nbsp;

There is a light in the city,

that never dies;

there is a light in the city,

each and every night.
