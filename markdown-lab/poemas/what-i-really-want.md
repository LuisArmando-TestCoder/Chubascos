What I really want

is to shine like a thrust

of a pulsar to your eyes,

coming back again

and coming back

with no end inside,

this is not just my ego,

this is egocentric nature

thriving in its natural lies.

&nbsp;

It does not feel like acid,

no more acid in my throat,

but bubbling lava that I pump

through my veins of tantalum.

&nbsp;

My sweat of purple alien blood,

I knew from the beginning

I was a damn alien in this world.

&nbsp;

Oh lord, how would I adapt

if it seems that my shape is way,

way deformed for this

puzzle of a group,

that composes with its individuals

a bigger and timeless soul.

&nbsp;

So, how can I shine

ultraviolet light

to their biased eyes?
