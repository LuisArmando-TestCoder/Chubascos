We do believe,

we, hopeless romantics.

&nbsp;

I witnessed a goddess

with a graceful sight

upon me,

what was I then?

Are we two gods

looking at each other?

&nbsp;

Our eyes resonated,

our eyes kissed,

our eyes held time tight,

how can eyes be

so violent at ease?

&nbsp;

How can eyes

swallow a soul?

How can such sight

inhale my ghost?

Darling, I'm a spirit,

I live in your lungs.

&nbsp;

This time

I want to take you to the abyss

and light it on

with the sparks

of our lithe gestures,

we ought them

to be unapologetic.
