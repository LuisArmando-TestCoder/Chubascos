We do believe,

we, hopeless romantics,

a look can mean something;

donâ€™t laugh, I mean it.

 

I witnessed a goddess

with a graceful sight

upon me,

what was I then?

 

Our eyes resonated,

our eyes kissed,

how can I eyes be

so violent in ease?

&nbsp;

How can your eyes

inhale my soul?

As I, my goddess,

inhale yours.

 

This time

I want to take you to the abyss

and light it on with the sparks

of our lithe gestures.
