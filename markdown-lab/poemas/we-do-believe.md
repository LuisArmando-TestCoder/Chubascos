We do believe,

we, hopeless romantics.

&nbsp;

I witnessed a goddess

with a graceful sight

upon me,

what was I then?

Are we two gods

looking at each other?

&nbsp;

Our eyes resonated,

our eyes kissed,

our eyes held time tight,

how can I eyes be

so violent at ease?

&nbsp;

How can your eyes

inhale my soul?

As I, my goddess,

visit yours;

I want, my darling,

to live within them.

&nbsp;

This time

I want to take you to the abyss

and light it on

with the sparks

of our lithe gestures,

we ought our gestures to move on

into each other.
