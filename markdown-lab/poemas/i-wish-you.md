I wish you

attentive ears,

hugs, friends and love.

&nbsp;

I wish you experiences for which

you can feel grateful of,

a sense of self worth,

to worth what surrounds you.

&nbsp;

I wish you success and hope;

being proud of your bravery

and your actions.

&nbsp;

I wish you a north

with a spec of surprise

in the horizon.

&nbsp;

I wish you excitement

for the next day,

and the day after,

and so on.

&nbsp;

I wish you happiness;

a peaceful sleep;

somebody to share

your memories with;

somebody that makes you think

that you are fine,

very fine and very great,

even though, sometimes,

you might be wrong,

and that despite it all,

you are loved, regardless.

&nbsp;

I wish so much for everybody,

I wish so much for all of us;

I wish you don't even have

to think about wishing anymore.

&nbsp;

I wish that you enter a loop

in which you don't mind

about eternity,

in which

is a pleasure to be born.
