If I told you the times

I brought someone up from the dead

you'll be pleased and scared:

are you a necromancer?

&nbsp;

Your cracking voice in despair:

could you please resurrect me?

&nbsp;

We all know that it hurts,

as the agora of ghosts

still contains brothers

wanting to hide their carapace.

&nbsp;

But the shell is ugly,

we all know about it.

&nbsp;

Can you see my beauty

across my crannies?

&nbsp;

I only resurrect the ones

who were looking for an answer,

but, what's the question?

was this all worth it?

&nbsp;

Come on specter,

from one to another,

this is not about worth,

cuz you are a spider.

&nbsp;

Worth comes out of you

like from you comes fabric.

&nbsp;

Nothing is worth it

unless you make it.

&nbsp;

If you, deep down,

expected love

out of your doings,

it takes someone

really wonderful

to love you with every bit

of your wrong doings.

&nbsp;

They might be special

just like you are,

with special gifts

and afraid of rejection,

you have to be loyal and upright

to the one that gets you

every time

without your permission.

&nbsp;

Not everyone is made to love you,

almost everybody won't know

how real love really feels like,

so you better open the door.

&nbsp;

If amazement you want to produce,

amazement first

you have to make them taste,

and then they'll have new preferences.

&nbsp;

You don't have to fit them,

their inclinations always change.

&nbsp;

So you fit your dreams,

which are truly endless.
