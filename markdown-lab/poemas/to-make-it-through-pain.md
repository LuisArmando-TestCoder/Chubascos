To make it through pain,

we have to embrace solitude.

&nbsp;

To be one more,

in a sea of numbers,

surrounded but

without friends,

feels very lonely,

to a creature

who has to find

a way to ignore it.

&nbsp;

And day by day,

the breakdown asks

to open the door,

and when everything goes quiet,

it screams louder,

it knocks harder,

up to a point

in which it makes you think,

if you don’t open it,

a remembrance will slip under,

and memories and truths

will flood your house,

and thoughts will slam

the door down.

&nbsp;

Almost everybody

has a chance,

but that almost displays

the open door

that leaves a shadow

of unfairness around

the dim rift of opportunity,

yes, the fools from the light

won’t notice that opaques

are being thrown

out the rift of opportunity.

&nbsp;

I’m on the verge,

in a come and go of visibility.

If I’m not shining,

they’re not seeing me.

&nbsp;

But this is what I wanted,

to catch some suicidals

in the Grand Canyon

and give some of this reflection,

to walk across the edge,

with a sight of hope.
