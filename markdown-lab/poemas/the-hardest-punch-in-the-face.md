The hardest punch in the face

made me see all things straight,

philosophy made me say

that nothing matters.

&nbsp;

Not me, nor somebody else,

I'm free to aim where I want,

just my feet on the ground,

there are no ladders.

&nbsp;

An illusion and faith,

being human is ok,

I was climbing some sake,

but ego caused a stutter.

&nbsp;

My new dream for today,

is to take risks and then play,

extravagance that can't help

but to display in command.

&nbsp;

I can feel all the chills;

so my feet can scream:

go away from that house

and please be honest.

&nbsp;

If you are a monster, my dear,

I don't want you play

hide and seek with nobody,

cause you are fine just way you are,

let them stare, and let them bark,

punch them in the face

when they're crossing the line.

&nbsp;

Let the ones hungry for drama,

die of starvation.

&nbsp;

You might call yourself abnormal,

but you are who you are,

the past is the past.

and the present,

a red carpet in your City of Stars.

&nbsp;

You gotta say “no”, sometimes,

and then go take risks,

but the ones that you like,

destiny is no more than a complex

simplistic paradigm.

&nbsp;

If you mold right now.

some mold will pop out;

weren't you clay after all?

A god amongst ants?

&nbsp;

Your words are a stained glass,

to a landscape that displays your path.

Your words can be sacred,

if you back them up with sacred acts.

&nbsp;

The laughs are no other

than particles in the air,

don't let them make you cry, or swear,

or take yourself less seriously.

&nbsp;

You can take yourself

as seriously as you want.

&nbsp;

Who told you having faith was a sin?

Maybe the ones who saw it as hope;

but there are wrongs that look right;

faith shows certainty in one's acts.

&nbsp;

They will laugh, talk and then forget,

so don't look for their acceptance,

because their focus never lasts,

so please, I beg to myself,

don't look for their acceptance,

but your own; learn to be alone;

being real, being whole,

and dying proud, at last;

isn't that what you wanted?

Dying with a smile.
