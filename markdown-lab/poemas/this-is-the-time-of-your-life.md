This is the time of your life

to step out of the line;

a veil we decide

to rip from the inside out.

&nbsp;

We jump from a window,

the womb of our mothers;

mama and our darkness,

this is our goodbye.

&nbsp;

Holy enlightenment that faces the night,

I'm the sun that comes up

when pop out from the sidewalk;

I'm the chills, I'm the light,

in a storm when I'm lightning,

in the holes of the clouds,

I'm the sunray that lasers,

making fears vow.

&nbsp;

I'm the highway, ¡holy cow!

Speeding brain cells shouting loud.

&nbsp;

Think I've just got it

and this is how,

I've just started it,

the Ragnarök,

and what is coming,

a brand new World;

no more stutter

or broken laws,

no floating spirits

adrift in love.

&nbsp;

I got my shelter,

my body is whole,

this is Omniverse,

playground to explore.

&nbsp;

So just keep looking

what feet adore;

I feel Pandora's

sense of true hope,

and now I know better,

now I know more;

uncertainty is bitter,

but I can move on.

&nbsp;

I will raise,

I'll step up;

I believe

Heaven's above.

&nbsp;

My fingers stretched

they'll grab my awe,

I'll be free,

a zombie no more.

&nbsp;

In a suit, with a case,

I don't like how it tastes.

&nbsp;

I prefer to immerse

in a rift of the sea

in the abyssal zone,

where myself and my focus

are one on its own.
